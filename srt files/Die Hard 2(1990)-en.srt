1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,400
Hey! Whoa! Yo!
False alarm! Hold it!

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,900
It's O.K.! I'm here.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,900
Here we are!
It's all right.

4
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,800
Set it down
nice and easy, huh?

5
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,310
Yeah, sure,
at the impound.

6
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,600
Next time,
read the sign.

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,871
Hey, you don't
understand.

8
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:50,881
Look, I'm just here
to meet my wife's plane.

9
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:52,381
You got to let me
have this car.

10
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:53,881
Yeah, sure, tomorrow,
8:00 to 4:00.

11
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:55,381
You pay 40 bucks,
we give it back.

12
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:56,751
Don't write it up.
Don't write it up.

13
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,881
Come on, man. This is
my mother-in-law's car.

14
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:01,861
She's already mad at me
'cause I'm not a dentist.

15
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,931
Look, I'm a cop-
L.A.P.D.

16
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,891
Oh, I was in L.A. once.
Hated it.

17
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:07,891
Well, I can understand.

18
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,161
I don't like it
much myself-Hey!

19
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,792
That's a plastic fender up there!
Take it easy!

20
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:13,932
Cut me some slack,
will you?

21
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:15,502
Look, I used to be
a cop in New York City.

22
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:18,162
I only moved to L.A.
because my wife took a job there.

23
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:19,432
Come on.
What do you say?

24
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:20,512
Here we are-

25
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,842
Washington, D.C.,
the heart of democracy.

26
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:24,742
One hand
washes the other.

27
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,412
Come on, man.
It's Christmas.

28
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:29,012
So ask Santa Claus
to give you another car.

29
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,522
Merry Christmas, pal.

30
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:34,023
It's all yours, Murray.

31
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:39,523
Son of a bitch.

32
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:16,935
Yeah, I know that,
Larry.

33
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:20,835
Snow flurries along
the northeastern seaboard...

34
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:22,965
Hi. Where are
the telephones?

35
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,045
Right over there.

36
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,505
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:27,515
Thank you. Leonard Adkins
is in a warmer clime

38
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,345
with a story that grows
hotter by the minute.

39
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:31,855
Security was tight today
at Escalan Airport

40
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:33,745
in the Republic
of Valverde

41
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,845
where government
authorities report

42
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,855
that deposed General
Ramon Esperanza

43
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:40,226
will be delivered
for immediate extradition

44
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,526
to the United States.

45
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,156
Only two years ago,
General Esperanza

46
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,856
led his country's army

47
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,496
in a campaign against
Communist insurgents,

48
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:50,366
a campaign fought with
American money and advisers.

49
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,376
Esperanza's fall from power
caused ripples

50
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,446
not only in his country's
recent election,

51
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:57,406
but closer to home,
as well,

52
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:59,876
when high-ranking
Pentagon officials were charged

53
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:02,747
with supplying him with weapons
despite the Congressional ban.

54
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:05,317
But mounting evidence
that Esperanza's forces

55
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,617
violated the neutrality
of neighboring countries

56
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:09,887
made Congress
withhold funds,

57
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:11,827
funds which Esperanza
is accused of replacing

58
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:13,557
by going into
the lucrative business

59
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,187
of cocaine smuggling.

60
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,027
Although Esperanza was removed
as Commander In Chief

61
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,607
earlier this year,

62
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:23,327
the agreement to extradite him
was only reached yesterday,

63
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:24,698
and Washington
insiders say

64
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:26,538
it was a phone call
that made it happen,

65
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:27,838
a phone call
from a-

66
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:34,848
All right, all right.

67
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,358
If I could find a phone,

68
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,358
I'd call you,
whoever you are.

69
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,820
Bye.

70
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,360
Excuse me.
Thank you.

71
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,340
Yeah, this is
Lieutenant McClane.

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Somebody there
just beep me?

73
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,600
I'd like to think
I'm somebody.

74
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,301
Honey,
where are you?

75
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,341
Did you land yet?

76
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:35,351
It's the nineties,
remember?

77
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:38,471
Microchips, microwaves,
faxes, airphones.

78
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:41,351
Yeah, well, as far
as I'm concerned,

79
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:43,441
progress peaked
with frozen pizza.

80
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:45,351
Listen, um,
we're going to be

81
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,361
about half an hour
late landing, O.K.?

82
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,861
I just wanted
to let you know.

83
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:50,331
The kids O.K.?

84
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,362
Yeah, well, they're about
to lose their minds

85
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:54,232
from all the sugar
your parents are giving them.

86
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:56,362
Did Mom give you
a hard time

87
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:57,872
about borrowing
her new car?

88
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,632
No. Not yet.

89
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:01,872
Listen, honey,
when you land,

90
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:04,312
can we just, like,
you know, rent a car,

91
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:06,312
check into a hotel,

92
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,812
leave the kids
with your parents,

93
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:10,352
order some room service?

94
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:13,322
A bottle of champagne,
what do you say?

95
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:14,913
You're on, Lieutenant.

96
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,323
I'll see you in about
a half an hour, honey.

97
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:18,653
I love you. Bye.

98
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,023
Isn't technology
wonderful?

99
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,833
My husband
doesn't think so.

100
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,563
Well, I do.

101
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:33,833
I used to carry around
those awful mace things.

102
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:35,343
Now...

103
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:41,284
I zap any bastard
that screws with me.

104
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,854
I tried it
on my little dog.

105
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,584
Poor thing
limped for a week.

106
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:51,354
Heh.

107
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:58,424
Excuse me.

108
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:02,365
Well, you look really
familiar to me.

109
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:05,305
I get that a lot.
I've been on TV.

110
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:07,135
Yeah. Me, too.

111
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:32,836
Grab the tools,
will you?

112
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,306
You got it.

113
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,836
This is Amy Nichole

114
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:37,836
reporting live
from Escalan Airport

115
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,736
where deposed general
Ramon Esperanza

116
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:42,336
has just arrived
under heavy guard.

117
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:45,247
Strangely, the deposed
dictator's mood seems jubilant.

118
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:47,847
He is smiling and waving
to the crowd

119
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,817
like a man
running for political office.

120
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:54,147
...thousands of political
prisoners in the past decade,

121
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:55,847
including
the new president,

122
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,087
and there's no doubt
that he still has

123
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:01,357
some ardent supporters
both here and abroad.

124
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:04,227
Rumours abound on Capitol Hill
that there were other...

125
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:07,768
Yeah?

126
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,068
Sorry to
bother you, sir.

127
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,198
We're checking
our equipment.

128
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,368
Any problems with
the conduit line?

129
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:14,378
Gee, I don't know
anything about that.

130
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,778
Would you mind
if we take a look?

131
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:18,278
Help yourself.

132
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:31,289
It just don't seem
right somehow-

133
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,799
closing down
this church.

134
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,799
The parish is going to
keep on using it,

135
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,299
but it won't
be the same.

136
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,309
Been here
a lot of years,

137
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,309
and I've been
right here with it.

138
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,039
Yeah, I kind of
feel like

139
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,409
a piece of me is dying
along with this church.

140
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,239
Well, you're right
about that.

141
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,250
...cocaine smuggling,

142
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,980
racketeering, and bribing
government officials.

143
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,690
He certainly
doesn't show it,

144
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,700
but no matter
how high his spirits,

145
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,200
they can't hide the fact

146
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,530
that America's
war on drugs

147
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,290
has finally taken
its first prisoner.

148
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,460
This is Buckwheat.
The clubhouse is open.

149
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,501
Here at Dulles, the quiet men
from the justice department

150
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:20,311
wait to handcuff the man
who has come to symbolize

151
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,821
the enemy in America's
fight against cocaine.

152
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,821
That battle may be
almost won,

153
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,821
but the war
is still in doubt.

154
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:29,321
Samantha Coleman, WNTW,
for Night-Time News.

155
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:30,821
Roger that,
Colonel. Out.

156
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:48,672
That was the colonel.

157
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:50,372
Everyone's in position.

158
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:51,842
How's the weather?

159
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:54,852
We got flurries all along
the Virginia coast.

160
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,783
New storm front coming in
from the northeast.

161
00:08:57,893 --> 00:08:58,883
Heh heh.

162
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:01,353
God loves
the infantry.

163
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:02,653
Amen.

164
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:05,163
Carry out
your assignments.

165
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,063
15:51. Mark.

166
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:12,793
Check.

167
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:14,233
Later.

168
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:15,673
Adios.

169
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:38,324
Hey, it's cold
out there, man!

170
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,334
I stomped my feet
for five minutes.

171
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:41,525
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:53,015
Two cappuccinos.
Make it fast.

173
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,866
Scotch straight up,
please.

174
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,196
Excuse me, Officers.

175
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:18,036
This may sound like
a wild-goose chase,

176
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:19,666
but I think
I just saw-

177
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:23,866
Saw what?

178
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:26,677
Elvis. Elvis Presley.

179
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:32,007
Fuckin' tourists.
Ought to be a law.

180
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:33,387
Excuse me. There's
a large number of you

181
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:34,917
from the justice department
here this evening.

182
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:36,887
Is there any particular
reason for that?

183
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:37,887
Just routine.

184
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:38,887
Just routine?

185
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:39,897
Yes.

186
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:40,897
Any comment, sir?

187
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:41,987
Not now.

188
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:43,997
Thank you, sir.
Thanks.

189
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:51,668
Hey, that's
Colonel Stuart over there.

190
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,898
Got a little problem
with personnel.

191
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:55,908
Last-minute replacement.

192
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:58,068
How's the security
around this place?

193
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,118
Like we figured-
a joke.

194
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:02,518
Colonel Stuart, could we have
a few words, please?

195
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,918
You can have two-
"fuck" and " you. "

196
00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:07,458
No pictures,
you pinko bitch.

197
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:10,789
Old news.

198
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,069
Oh!

199
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,229
Damn it!

200
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,240
Excuse me.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,400
Hey, man.

202
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:55,401
What is it?

203
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,411
You got a key
for this door?

204
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:58,911
Yeah. Why?

205
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,811
Because I want you to
open it up, that's why.

206
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:06,351
Is there a cop on duty
around here?

207
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:07,681
The airport police.

208
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,081
Go get them.

209
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:35,312
Ha ha ha!

210
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,382
Hand me the wrench.

211
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:39,383
Going to work
overtime.

212
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,283
Good idea.

213
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,793
O.K., hold that end.

214
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:46,883
Watch it, man.

215
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:50,393
All right.
Perfect. Perfect.

216
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,403
Good to go.

217
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,063
Hey!

218
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,673
It's a restricted area.

219
00:12:56,773 --> 00:12:58,533
What's the matter?

220
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:00,073
Couldn't wait
for the skycap?

221
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:01,074
We work here.

222
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:03,144
Let's see some I.D.

223
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:04,334
Ha ha.

224
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:06,434
Sure. No problem.

225
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:49,756
Oh,jeez. Fuck!

226
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,547
Hiyah!

227
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,198
What is this-
a tag team?

228
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:01,269
Aah!

229
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:02,499
Aah!

230
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,939
- Aah!
- Aah!

231
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:14,310
You say he came in here
and flashed a badge?

232
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,410
Yeah. He said to bring
you guys back here.

233
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,550
Uh! Ah!

234
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,360
Aah! Aah!

235
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,830
Aah! Aah!

236
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:37,801
Oh!

237
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:44,381
Christ.

238
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,322
Fucker!

239
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,362
Freeze!

240
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,842
Nice guess, asshole.
I'm a cop.

241
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:11,602
That was
the bad guy.

242
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,702
Where's your I.D.?

243
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:20,513
On its way
to Cleveland?

244
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:27,353
No, you did not
explain anything.

245
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:28,853
All you did was
shove me back here

246
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:30,363
into this
cattle car.

247
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,863
Sir, you were told
when you boarded

248
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:33,363
that we were
overbooked.

249
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:35,023
Fine. Done.
I accept that.

250
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:37,363
But why can't I get
the first-class meal?

251
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:39,873
My network paid for it.
Do you know who I am?

252
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,303
Yes. We've all
seen your program.

253
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:42,874
Your episode
"Flying Junkyards"

254
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:45,444
was a very objective look
at air traffic safety.

255
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:46,914
It wasn't nearly
as edifying

256
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,574
as " Bimbos OfThe Sky,"
was it, Connie?

257
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:51,474
You think
you're funny.

258
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:53,074
You think you're funny.

259
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,944
Fine.

260
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:56,384
I've got
your number.

261
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:57,924
And I've got yours.

262
00:16:58,024 --> 00:17:00,154
So park it, sir.

263
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,354
Fine.

264
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:14,135
Stewardess.

265
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:15,735
Mr. Thornberg,

266
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:17,575
you cannot
monopolize my time.

267
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,445
You cannot put me
near that woman.

268
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:20,975
Excuse me?

269
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:23,845
He means he's filed
a restraining order

270
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:25,855
against me.

271
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:29,116
I'm not allowed
within 50 feet of him.

272
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:31,156
50 yards.

273
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:33,356
So by keeping me
in this section,

274
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:35,856
you are violating
a court order.

275
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:38,366
I can sue you
and this airline.

276
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:40,366
That woman assaulted me,

277
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:42,936
and she humiliated me
in public.

278
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:50,947
What did you do?

279
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:55,537
Knocked out
two of his teeth.

280
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:58,647
Would you like
some champagne?

281
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:04,827
Sorry, Officer McClane.
I had to check.

282
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,327
Here's your piece
and shield back.

283
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:09,697
Thanks.

284
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,528
Over here, Officer!

285
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:13,298
We understand that
there was a shooting.

286
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:16,098
The presence ofJustice
Department officials...

287
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,608
Jesus!

288
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,608
Hey, come on.
Just a word, O.K.?

289
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,108
What the fuck
are you people-

290
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,608
What are you
doing here, man?

291
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,108
This is a crime scene.

292
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:26,078
You got to seal
this area off.

293
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:28,238
That's
up to the captain.

294
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,578
Maybe you better take me

295
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:31,848
up to the captain,
then, huh?

296
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:42,459
Where's Cochrane?

297
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,539
He didn't make it.

298
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,439
You're late.

299
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,450
We ran into trouble,
Colonel.

300
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,180
Some cop...
killed Cochrane.

301
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,550
I barely got away,
sir.

302
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,620
Did you accomplish
your mission?

303
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,120
Yes, sir, but...
Cochrane, sir.

304
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,130
Well, then
the damage is minimal.

305
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,130
The penalty
could be severe.

306
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:23,541
You fail me again,

307
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,131
and the chamber
won't be empty.

308
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:27,971
Dismissed.

309
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:33,651
Miss. Miss.
I can't find my dog.

310
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:35,151
Miss. My dog.

311
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:36,651
One minute, ma'am.

312
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,721
I want you
to fill out this form.

313
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:47,962
Who is it?
Come in.

314
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:49,162
Captain Lorenzo?

315
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,172
Yeah.

316
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,172
I'm John McClane-

317
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,002
Yeah, yeah.
I know who you are.

318
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:55,662
You're the asshole
that just broke seven FAA

319
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,672
and five District
of Columbia regulations

320
00:19:57,782 --> 00:19:59,302
running around
my airport

321
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:01,142
with a gun,
shooting at people.

322
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:02,943
What do you call
that shit?

323
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:04,313
Self-defense.

324
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:06,683
Well, what, you think
that L.A. badge

325
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,683
is going to get you

326
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,693
a free lunch or something
around here?

327
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,193
Well... maybe a little
professional courtesy.

328
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:15,523
Huh! In an airport
on Christmas week?

329
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,183
You've got to be
kidding.

330
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:18,693
O.K. Fuck courtesy.

331
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:20,203
How about just
being professional?

332
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,203
Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene, Captain.

333
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,204
You can't wrap this thing
up in 10 minutes.

334
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:25,704
You got to
seal the area off,

335
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,364
take pictures,
dust for prints.

336
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:29,604
Hey, don't
lecture me, hotshot.

337
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:31,204
I know
what I'm doing.

338
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,714
We're going
to dust it down.

339
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,714
We'll take all the pictures.
We'll sweep for fibers.

340
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:36,214
When are you
going to do this?

341
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:37,714
After 300 or 400
people go through?

342
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:39,214
You'd be lucky
to get a print

343
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:40,844
from one
of your own people.

344
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:41,854
Just shut down
that area and-

345
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,724
Oh,just
shut the area down.

346
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:46,555
It's that simple, huh?
Just shut the area down?

347
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,895
Yeah, and I got everybody

348
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:50,725
from the Shriners'
Convention

349
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:53,235
to goddamn Boy Scouts
traipsing through here!

350
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,325
I got lost kids,
lost dogs-

351
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:57,495
Not now! Later!

352
00:20:57,605 --> 00:20:58,735
I got international
diplomats.

353
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:01,745
I got a fuckin' reindeer
flying in here

354
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,675
from the fuckin'
petting zoo!

355
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:06,175
ButJohn McClane,
he's got a little problem.

356
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:08,646
Hell, let's shut down
the whole fuckin' airport!

357
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:10,346
What do you think
they're going to say upstairs

358
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:11,686
when I tell them that?

359
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,226
Pick up the phone
and find out.

360
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:15,186
I don't need
fuckin' Forensics

361
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:16,696
to tell me
all this was

362
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:18,256
was some punk
stealing luggage!

363
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:20,426
Luggage? That punk
pulled a Glock 7 on me.

364
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:21,756
You know what that is?

365
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,696
It's a porcelain gun
made in Germany.

366
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:25,736
It doesn't show up
on your airport X-ray machines

367
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:27,706
and costs more than
you make in a month.

368
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:29,996
You'd be surprised
what I make in a month.

369
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:32,007
If it's more than $1.98,
I'd be very surprised.

370
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:33,707
Hey, McClane,
don't start believing

371
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:35,207
your own press, huh?

372
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:37,077
Yeah, yeah,
I know all about you

373
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:38,737
and that Nakatomi thing
in L.A.,

374
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:41,217
but just because the TV
thinks you're hot shit,

375
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:42,347
that don't make it so.

376
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:45,517
Look, you are
in my little pond now,

377
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:48,887
and I am the big fish
that runs it.

378
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:51,757
So you capped
some lowlife.

379
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:52,858
Fine.

380
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:55,228
I'll send your
fuckin' captain in L.A.

381
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:56,738
a fuckin' commendation!

382
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,858
In the meantime,
get the hell out of my office

383
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,738
before I have you
thrown out of my goddamn airport!

384
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:14,688
Hey, Carmine, let me
ask you something.

385
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:17,309
What sets off the metal
detectors first-

386
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,049
the lead in your ass or
the shit in your brains?

387
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,749
Fat fuck.

388
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:33,239
Any I.D. on this guy?

389
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:35,279
That's somebody else's
problem.

390
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,980
Your car's ready.
Sign right here.

391
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,980
I need to borrow
this and this.

392
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,210
I'll bring it
right back.

393
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,220
Hey! Yo!
Hold up!

394
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,790
Yo!

395
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,730
Hold up, boys.
Hold up. Hold up.

396
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,730
We got to check
something.

397
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,730
What are you doing?

398
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,731
Pretty gruesome
fuckin'job.

399
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,731
All the confusion
in there,

400
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:04,131
forgot to get
this clown's prints.

401
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:07,171
Ew! Christ.

402
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:09,671
Hey, you're supposed
to do that at the morgue.

403
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,341
Not anymore.

404
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,241
Got a new S.O.P.
for DOAs from the FAA.

405
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:18,681
Ha ha! I don't think
this one's going to make it, boys.

406
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,251
Thanks a lot.

407
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:56,793
Ahh.

408
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:15,297
Powell here.

409
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:16,637
Take that Twinkie
out of your mouth

410
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:17,907
and grab a pencil,
will ya?

411
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,677
Ha ha! Hey,John,
how are you doing?

412
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,377
Holly stood me up
a day,

413
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,247
and I'm here alone
in D.C.

414
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,877
with my in-laws.

415
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:27,887
Eh, the old in-laws, huh?

416
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:30,757
They do love their
policemen son-in-laws.

417
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:32,227
Listen, Al,

418
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:34,557
what is the fax machine
telephone number

419
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:36,218
there at the station?

420
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:37,698
Uh...

421
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,198
555-3212.

422
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:43,898
3212. Hold on a second,
all right?

423
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:46,408
I want to send you
something.

424
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:47,438
Excuse me.

425
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,908
You and faxes?
This is a first.

426
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,408
Yeah, well,
Holly told me

427
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:53,568
I should wake up
and smell the nineties.

428
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:54,778
This way?

429
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,009
No. That way.

430
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,419
Wait.
It's upside down.

431
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,919
It doesn't matter.

432
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:01,489
O.K. Here it comes.

433
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,029
I'm sending you
something right now.

434
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:07,429
Hold on a second,
cowboy.

435
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,210
Fingerprints?

436
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,650
We've got an unidentified
stiff here.

437
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,880
I've circled
the whirls in pen

438
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,540
in case the transmission's
a little fuzzy.

439
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,210
Listen, run it
through state and federal,

440
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,810
and if you can,
run it through Interpol.

441
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,250
Will do.
Well, what's this about?

442
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,790
Oh,just a feeling
I have.

443
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,050
Ouch. When you get
those feelings,

444
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,290
insurance companies
start to go bankrupt.

445
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,201
Listen, the, uh,
fax number is...

446
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,771
Is on the top edge
of the transmission...

447
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:46,631
Is on the top edge

448
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:48,971
of the transmission
you just got.

449
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:52,101
Oh, an airport, huh?

450
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,271
Listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

451
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,571
Ha ha. Yeah.

452
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,651
And I'm fresh
out of chlorine.

453
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:07,152
Just as this storm
starts breaking,

454
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:10,192
the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.

455
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:12,352
Look at this new front
moving in.

456
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:14,762
Makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.

457
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:18,192
Well, I can sand down
all the runways

458
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:20,102
and keep the plows going
between landings,

459
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:22,102
but you got to
downshift them up there,

460
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:23,542
give me time to work.

461
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,772
You got it.

462
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:27,403
All right, everyone.

463
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:30,383
Let's call all our birds
and slow them down

464
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,213
before we get a parking lot
over our heads.

465
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:35,223
The line starts
at the Mississippi,

466
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:37,383
and they better start
taking numbers.

467
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,324
Can I get you another?

468
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:52,564
No, thank you.

469
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:54,374
I only have to
look at his face

470
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:55,844
for another 15
or 20 minutes.

471
00:27:55,944 --> 00:28:00,344
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

472
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:02,614
I've just been informed
by Dulles Traffic Control

473
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,114
that there's a weather front
moving in ahead of us.

474
00:28:05,224 --> 00:28:08,814
We may be up here
a little while longer.

475
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:10,185
Thank you.

476
00:28:10,295 --> 00:28:11,755
On second
thought...

477
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:20,095
Al?

478
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,105
Hey, I'm right here,
partner.

479
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:25,035
Your stiff's dossier is
coming through right now.

480
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,305
What can you
tell me about him?

481
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,605
He's dead.

482
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:31,805
You needed a computer
to figure that one out?

483
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:33,716
No, no. You don't
follow me.

484
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:35,876
According to
the Department of Defense,

485
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:38,016
he's been dead
for two years.

486
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,386
What?

487
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:42,356
That's right. Sergeant
Oswald Cochrane.

488
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:44,056
American adviser
in Honduras.

489
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:47,756
Killed in a helicopter
accident 5-11-88.

490
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:49,386
Officer.

491
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,896
Read between the lines,
and I'd say it looks

492
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:53,906
like a lot of black-bag
stuff to me.

493
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:55,407
Yeah, I see it.

494
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:57,067
All right, Al.
Thanks a lot.

495
00:28:57,177 --> 00:28:58,077
Hey, anytime.

496
00:28:58,177 --> 00:28:59,297
O.K.

497
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:03,007
Say, I close
in about an hour.

498
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,417
Maybe we can go
get a drink?

499
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:09,447
Just the fax, ma'am.

500
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:11,047
Just the fax.

501
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:17,858
Hey, wait a second.
Wait. I see somebody.

502
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:19,228
I'll call you back.

503
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:26,998
The Ghost
of Christmas Past.

504
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:29,538
Nakatomi? L.A.? You're
John McClane, right?

505
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:31,038
Who are you?

506
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:33,408
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

507
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:34,908
Excuse me.

508
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:37,108
Give me a break.
I saw the stiff.

509
00:29:37,218 --> 00:29:39,649
Word is that was
your handiwork.

510
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:42,149
No. I only do
needlepoint.

511
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,389
Great. National
just shut down.

512
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,159
Totally iced.

513
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,389
They're going to
be sending us their planes.

514
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,559
Happy, happy holiday.

515
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:55,899
The worst part,
Mr. Trudeau,

516
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:57,059
was the press.

517
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:58,729
Oh, they were
here anyways,

518
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,809
crawling all over
the Esperanza story,

519
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:01,740
so they got it right
on the fucking news.

520
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,240
You know,
bloodstains and all.

521
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,400
Personally, I'd like
to lock every damn reporter

522
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,410
out of the airport,
but then they'd just pull

523
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,410
that freedom-of-speech
crap on us.

524
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,380
Then the ACLU would be
all over us.

525
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,750
Murder on television.

526
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,520
Hell of a start
for Christmas weekend.

527
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,220
What is it? A gang thing
like last time?

528
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,120
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

529
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:24,501
Who the hell
is this?

530
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:25,501
Uh-uh,
McClane.

531
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,031
I'm a police officer.

532
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,601
In an unauthorized area.

533
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,331
L.A., Mr. Trudeau,
don't mean shit.

534
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:33,101
That's what I said about
my last cholesterol test.

535
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:36,901
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

536
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:39,771
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo
has explained to you

537
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:43,041
the minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.

538
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:45,782
Maybe he can explain this.

539
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:05,472
All systems
tapped, Colonel.

540
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,972
Fire it up.

541
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:23,923
" H" minus five minutes.

542
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:25,493
Stand by.

543
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,493
All right. We've got
a body in the morgue

544
00:31:29,603 --> 00:31:31,034
that seems
to have died twice.

545
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:32,364
Assuming it's not
a computer error,

546
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,634
what do we assume?

547
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:34,934
That somebody's about
to seriously fuck

548
00:31:35,044 --> 00:31:36,064
with this airport.

549
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:37,874
What is that
supposed to mean?

550
00:31:37,974 --> 00:31:39,874
I mean, I know we're dummies
up here, McClane,

551
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:42,074
so give us a taste
of your genius.

552
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:43,584
This a hijacking?
A robbery? What?

553
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:45,204
Look, I'm not sure.

554
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:48,214
Oh, he's not sure.
Well, I'm stunned.

555
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,714
I got to lie down.

556
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,784
The only people that go
to this much trouble

557
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:53,915
are professionals-
not luggage thieves and not punks.

558
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,455
Professional at what?

559
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:56,785
What the fuck do you
think this is, huh,

560
00:31:56,895 --> 00:31:57,985
the safety patrol here?

561
00:31:58,095 --> 00:32:00,085
This is the resume
of a professional mercenary.

562
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:01,965
You got the world's
biggest drug dealer on his way here.

563
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:03,965
You need a slide rule
to figure this out,

564
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:05,765
or maybe another
body in a zipper bag

565
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,065
before you start
asking questions?

566
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,505
You're the one that gave us
that fucking body.

567
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:10,505
Remember that.

568
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:12,045
Yeah, I remember that.

569
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:21,646
Lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in. Now.

570
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,316
What? You're not
buying into this?

571
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,356
I want them to report
anything out of the ordinary,

572
00:32:26,456 --> 00:32:28,156
no matter how trivial.
You got that?

573
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:29,316
Yeah, I got it.

574
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:30,486
Oh, my God!

575
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:31,826
What?

576
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:33,326
The runways.

577
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:35,266
What the hell?

578
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:36,597
They're shutting down.

579
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:37,827
Jesus Christ.

580
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:45,947
Go to emergency
lighting now.

581
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,417
Emergency. We are
in a code yellow.

582
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,317
Backup systems
won't come up.

583
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:52,507
Shunt to another
terminal.

584
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:54,107
Bobby, what
do you got?

585
00:32:54,217 --> 00:32:56,187
Nothing.
The whole network is down.

586
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:58,057
Maybe we should call
the power company, huh?

587
00:32:58,157 --> 00:32:59,958
We're on the same goddamn grid.
We're hot.

588
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:01,958
Dulles, what's going on?
I'm on approach.

589
00:33:02,068 --> 00:33:03,398
Maintain position. Repeat.

590
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:05,468
What's going on down there?

591
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,728
Roger. We're on it.

592
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:08,068
We're unable right now.
Please delay.

593
00:33:08,168 --> 00:33:11,568
Fuji 604. Execute published
missed-approach procedure

594
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:12,838
and hold.

595
00:33:12,938 --> 00:33:15,408
TWA 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

596
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:18,208
Climb to and maintain
one zero thousand.

597
00:33:18,318 --> 00:33:21,379
I've checked all systems.
It ain't happening.

598
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:35,919
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

599
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:37,429
What's it
look like?

600
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:38,929
Approach control-
it's gone.

601
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,129
Jesus. Instrument
landing system is down.

602
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,670
Confirmed.
I LS is dead.

603
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,210
Every goddamn
system's dead.

604
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,780
And Inmac monitors
are down.

605
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,890
Attention all controllers.
Attention.

606
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,420
We have a code-red alert.

607
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,080
Every aircraft
approaching our sector

608
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,180
who are not already
in our landing pattern

609
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,421
gets diverted
to their alternate airport now.

610
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:10,401
Everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern

611
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,901
holds at the outer markers.

612
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:15,901
Stack 'em, pack 'em,
and rack 'em.

613
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:17,031
Move.

614
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,541
Get someone on it!

615
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:25,741
All right. Not a word
of this leaves this room.

616
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,322
There must be 15,000 people
in this airport,

617
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:30,982
and we don't need panic
on our hands.

618
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:33,112
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

619
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:35,122
After that,
those planes low on fuel

620
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:37,092
aren't going to
be circling.

621
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,892
They're going to be dropping
on the White House lawn.

622
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:45,032
McClane, this
what you expected?

623
00:34:45,142 --> 00:34:47,432
No.

624
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:50,533
This is just
the beginning.

625
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:56,083
FAA hot line.

626
00:34:56,183 --> 00:34:57,813
How could they
know already?

627
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:59,213
They can't.

628
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:03,183
Maybe it's the boys
that pulled all your plugs.

629
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:05,623
Put it on speaker.

630
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:09,623
Attention, Dulles Tower.
Attention.

631
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,754
They say that blind men
become very attentive

632
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:13,064
by way of compensation.

633
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:14,794
Now that you're both
blind and deaf,

634
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,894
I think I've got
your attention.

635
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:19,904
I'm aware your recorders
are active,

636
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,404
so I'll be quick.

637
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:23,844
You can play me back later
to your heart's content.

638
00:35:23,944 --> 00:35:26,434
How did you get on this line?
Who is this?

639
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:28,914
Who I am is unimportant.

640
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:30,414
What I want...

641
00:35:30,514 --> 00:35:32,244
Well, if you don't want
those planes

642
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:34,085
to start splashing
into the Potomac

643
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:35,745
as they run out
of fuel,

644
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:37,555
what I want is
very important.

645
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:39,755
Aplane will be landing
at this airport

646
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:41,195
in 58 minutes.

647
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:44,525
It is FM-1,
Foreign Military One.

648
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:46,435
Now, I'm sure you gentlemen
are well aware

649
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:47,465
of the unique nature...

650
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:48,505
Esperanza?

651
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,765
of this flight,

652
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:51,095
the importance
of its cargo.

653
00:35:51,205 --> 00:35:54,105
This plane will not
be met by anyone.

654
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:57,616
It will land on a runway
of my designation,

655
00:35:57,716 --> 00:36:01,016
where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.

656
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:03,556
That will conclude my interest
in this aircraft

657
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:05,416
and your responsibility
for it.

658
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:09,886
At the same time, I want
a 747 cargo conversion

659
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:13,686
fully fueled
and placed at my disposal.

660
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,626
You have two more minutes
to advise your inbound aircraft

661
00:36:17,736 --> 00:36:19,167
to hold at their
outer radio marker.

662
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:22,067
After that,you will be
able to receive only.

663
00:36:22,177 --> 00:36:24,007
Any attempt to restore
your systems

664
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:26,837
will be met
by severe penalties.

665
00:36:26,947 --> 00:36:27,967
He's bluffing.

666
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:30,677
Damn it,
you can't do this.

667
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:32,747
I am doing this.

668
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,578
O.K., you guys,
listen up.

669
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:43,418
I need you to punch up
a code 15.

670
00:36:43,528 --> 00:36:45,428
I got an idea,
and I need your help.

671
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:46,728
If Esperanza gets
on that plane

672
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:48,628
and makes it to a country
with no extradition treaties,

673
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:49,928
we're fucked.

674
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:52,098
They're talking to us
on our own system.

675
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,298
They got to be close.

676
00:36:53,408 --> 00:36:55,028
I'll have my men tear
this airport apart.

677
00:36:55,138 --> 00:36:57,038
Just in the nick
of time, huh?

678
00:36:57,138 --> 00:36:59,338
Hey, McClane, I got
a first-class unit here,

679
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:00,538
S.W.A.T. team and all.

680
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:02,138
We don't need
any Monday-morning quarterbacks.

681
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:04,549
My wife's on one
of the goddamn planes

682
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:05,549
these guys
are fucking with.

683
00:37:05,649 --> 00:37:06,879
That puts me
on the playing field.

684
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:09,049
If you'd have moved your fat ass
when I told you to,

685
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,919
we wouldn't be hip deep
in shit right now.

686
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:12,919
That's it. Security.
You're out of here.

687
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:15,049
Mr. Trudeau, do I
have to remind you

688
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,319
about FAA regulations

689
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:17,589
regarding
unauthorized personnel

690
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:18,789
in the control tower?

691
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:20,919
All we have to do is find
a way to transmit.

692
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:22,729
Yeah, right. Somebody want
to run down to Radio Shack

693
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:23,729
and get a transmitter?

694
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:24,800
We already have one.

695
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,630
The new terminal wing
they're building-

696
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,970
20 airlines
when it's done,

697
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,630
all with their own
reservation computers,

698
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,710
all tied in to a nice
big antenna arrangement.

699
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,710
You'd better see
Mr. McClane out.

700
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,580
You got no business
being up here.

701
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,580
I'm telling you guys.
Everything we need

702
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,150
is over
by the Annex Skywalk

703
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,810
just sitting there,
waiting to go on line.

704
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,820
The Annex Skywalk?

705
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,980
Goddamn it, Trudeau.

706
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,150
You're dealing
with pros here.

707
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,750
You can't fuck
with these people.

708
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,761
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

709
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:49,091
Mr. Trudeau, there
are a lot of rumours

710
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,161
flying around here
today.

711
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:51,491
No way. No way, lady.

712
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:52,621
Hell, no. No.

713
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:54,891
This is off limits,
Coleman.

714
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:56,491
Get them
out of here.

715
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:59,161
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!

716
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:01,171
Get your fucking hands
off me.

717
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:03,171
For shit's sake.
Just get them both out of here.

718
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:06,511
Lobby Security,
come in.

719
00:38:06,611 --> 00:38:07,511
Tomalson here.

720
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:09,212
This is
Captain Lorenzo here

721
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:11,112
with two unauthorized personnel
in the fucking tower.

722
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,482
Now, would you get your thumb
out of your ass,

723
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,782
get them
out of the elevator,

724
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,792
or you're going to find
a goddamn pink slip

725
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:18,622
in your Christmas
stocking.

726
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:20,022
10-4. Let's go.

727
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,722
Goddamn!

728
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:24,392
Anything who
can think of?

729
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,402
Can't fuck
with what guy?

730
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:26,802
Shit. Hang on
over there.

731
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:27,922
Just hang on.

732
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:31,473
Big drug dealer on
his way to prison,

733
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:32,803
gunfight at airport,

734
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:34,813
every controller
in the coffee shop

735
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,473
getting beeped
and hauling ass,

736
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:37,983
and you rocking
the boat.

737
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,313
Connection?
Come on, McClane.

738
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:40,473
Just a few words.

739
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:42,213
O.K.,just a few words.
Fuck off.

740
00:38:42,323 --> 00:38:46,813
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

741
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:49,153
Stuart. The guy that got
canned by Congress.

742
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:50,353
That's who he was.

743
00:38:50,463 --> 00:38:53,093
Huh? Who he who?
What? Hey!

744
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:56,224
Shh! It's O.K.
I've done this before.

745
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:08,504
Hi.

746
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:10,344
Where's the other one?

747
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:11,474
Claustrophobic,
I guess.

748
00:39:14,014 --> 00:39:16,115
It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so close

749
00:39:16,225 --> 00:39:17,385
it doesn't matter.

750
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:19,285
I can rig our frequency
in 30 minutes,

751
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:21,125
wire in a crossover,
and we're hot.

752
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,025
Even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.

753
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,995
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

754
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:28,465
I want my S.W.A.T. team
to go with him as cover.

755
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:31,125
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.

756
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,476
Oh, man. I can't
fucking believe this.

757
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,476
Another basement.
Another elevator.

758
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:45,036
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

759
00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:07,677
What the fuck?

760
00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:12,007

in love with old

761
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:13,507


762
00:40:13,617 --> 00:40:15,167


763
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,837


764
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,217


765
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,188


766
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:27,528


767
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:32,328

with an ocean view

768
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:33,828


769
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:38,428

in love with old

770
00:40:38,538 --> 00:40:40,908


771
00:40:42,678 --> 00:40:44,609
Who are you?

772
00:40:46,149 --> 00:40:48,239
I'm Marvin.

773
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,009
Marvin. I'm Marvin.

774
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,019
I thought
you was trying

775
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,219
to steal my records,
that's all.

776
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,619
I'm just the janitor.

777
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:04,319
This is Dulles Approach
to all aircraft

778
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,459
holding at Potomac Vortex.

779
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,370
We are experiencing
some technical problems here.

780
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,370
Weather conditions, which have
been deteriorating all day,

781
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,970
have now been complicated
by an unforeseen human factor.

782
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,810
This has affected all
of our electronic equipment

783
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,980
and their redundant backups,
as well.

784
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,750
As a result, our Nav
and approach systems are down,

785
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,190
and we expect to lose voice
in another minute.

786
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,691
We want you to continue

787
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:32,731
holding at the outer marker
as directed

788
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:34,761
and wait
for further instructions.

789
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:36,961
As soon as we're
back on line,

790
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:40,161
we'll expedite your landings
on a fuel-emergency basis.

791
00:41:40,271 --> 00:41:42,761
Good luck.

792
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:47,201
God bless.

793
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,142
All right.
Change the boards.

794
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:24,243
Hey, stand back.

795
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:25,253
The Skywalk
Annex.

796
00:42:25,353 --> 00:42:26,843
No, Goddamn it.
The Annex Skywalk.

797
00:42:26,953 --> 00:42:29,353
It's the last thing
I heard

798
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:30,383
before they
kicked me out.

799
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:32,683
Well, let me
see here, now.

800
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:34,593
Well, this must be it
right there.

801
00:42:34,693 --> 00:42:37,224
See? That's
the raised platform,

802
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:39,424
and there's
the new terminal.

803
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:40,934
There's your Skywalk.

804
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:43,234
Goddamn bottleneck.

805
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:45,894
Nice place
for an ambush.

806
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:47,204
What's
the fastest way

807
00:42:47,304 --> 00:42:48,964
you can get me
out to that spot?

808
00:42:51,644 --> 00:42:54,974
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

809
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:57,144
Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.
We'll watch your back.

810
00:42:57,254 --> 00:42:59,115
Yeah? Who watches yours?

811
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:12,165
Main ventilation duct.

812
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:14,665
Main ventilation duct.

813
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:17,165
And bingo.

814
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:18,505
Just once,

815
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:21,906
I'd like a regular,
normal Christmas...

816
00:43:23,776 --> 00:43:28,686
Eggnog, a fucking
Christmas tree,

817
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:30,686
a little turkey...

818
00:43:30,786 --> 00:43:33,686
But, no, I got
to crawl around

819
00:43:33,786 --> 00:43:36,276
in this
motherfucking tin can.

820
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:43,967
We're in the Annex Skywalk.
I can see the array.

821
00:43:44,067 --> 00:43:45,997
I'll give you a call
for a protocol test

822
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:47,037
as soon as it's hot.

823
00:43:47,137 --> 00:43:48,327
That's all for now.

824
00:43:48,437 --> 00:43:50,837
Sergeant, we need
some more equipment.

825
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:52,737
I'd like to send one
of your guys back for it.

826
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,707
Right, sir.
You got it.

827
00:43:58,047 --> 00:43:59,807
What the hell's
going on?

828
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,907
Hey! Put that
back on!

829
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:06,818
Hey, asshole,
what do I look like to you?

830
00:44:06,928 --> 00:44:09,158
A sitting duck.

831
00:44:10,258 --> 00:44:12,058
Take him!

832
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:14,728
Shit!

833
00:44:16,268 --> 00:44:19,668
Damn it.
I hate it when I'm right.

834
00:44:23,878 --> 00:44:25,778
Look out!
Get down!

835
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:39,019
Aah!

836
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,270
Aah!

837
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:06,773
Stay down!

838
00:46:20,994 --> 00:46:22,324
Fuck!

839
00:46:31,444 --> 00:46:32,634
Come on.

840
00:46:53,735 --> 00:46:56,355
Fucking son
of a bitch.

841
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:03,406
Aah!

842
00:47:13,086 --> 00:47:14,346
Shit.

843
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,386
Ah. Oh.

844
00:47:24,797 --> 00:47:27,767
I'm going to kick
your fucking ass.

845
00:48:00,998 --> 00:48:02,468
Jeez.

846
00:48:02,568 --> 00:48:04,098
You all right?

847
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,798
Yeah. Yeah.
But the antenna array-

848
00:48:05,908 --> 00:48:08,069
I got to get to it
and set it up.

849
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:14,179
Get down!

850
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,700
Goddamn.

851
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,570
Bait.

852
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,680
Jerk us off,

853
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,340
make Lorenzo sacrifice
his best men.

854
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,751
Make you waste
your time...

855
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:57,661
time we don't have.

856
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:14,141
I think you're closer
than 50 yards.

857
00:49:14,241 --> 00:49:17,802
So's that airplane.
Practically.

858
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:20,252
Yeah. There's quite
a few of them out there.

859
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:22,252
It looks like
a regular traffic jam.

860
00:49:22,352 --> 00:49:24,382
There's nothing
regular about it.

861
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:26,822
See? You're intrigued.

862
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,482
That's my gift,
Mrs. McClane.

863
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:29,752
I notice things-

864
00:49:29,862 --> 00:49:31,662
things other people
wouldn't see.

865
00:49:31,762 --> 00:49:34,592
That's how I make
people curious.

866
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:36,532
Don't you mean
nauseous?

867
00:49:36,632 --> 00:49:39,163
Look. The people have
a right to know

868
00:49:39,273 --> 00:49:40,673
everything about everybody.

869
00:49:40,773 --> 00:49:43,103
You got
in the way of that.

870
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:46,043
Listen, buster, you
endangered my children,

871
00:49:46,143 --> 00:49:47,673
and you didn't do it

872
00:49:47,783 --> 00:49:49,683
for anything as noble
as the people.

873
00:49:49,783 --> 00:49:51,683
The only time you even
see the people

874
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,543
is when you look down

875
00:49:53,653 --> 00:49:56,243
to see what it is
you're stepping on.

876
00:49:58,283 --> 00:50:00,184
Me? Yeah, I'll live,

877
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:02,684
but Lorenzo's
S.W.A.T. team is dead,

878
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:05,184
and the antenna array
is gone.

879
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:09,194
Didn't you see it?

880
00:50:09,294 --> 00:50:12,264
It's hard looking
for a new miracle.

881
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:14,694
Just hold
for a minute.

882
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:16,024
I'll be
right back.

883
00:50:16,134 --> 00:50:17,034
Just hold
for a second.

884
00:50:17,134 --> 00:50:18,034
Something's
going on here.

885
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:21,195
Yeah. Just hold on
for a minute.

886
00:50:21,305 --> 00:50:25,205
I say again, Annex Team,
give us a sit rep.

887
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:28,275
Annex Team, come in.
Do you copy?

888
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:31,605
It's got some kind
of scrambler on it.

889
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:33,685
Can you do anything
with it?

890
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:35,915
No.
This scramble mode

891
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:37,915
must activate
on this code panel.

892
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:40,145
Even if we scan
their frequency,

893
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,315
we can't listen in.

894
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:43,255
These guys are pros.

895
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:44,386
So are you.
Break the code.

896
00:50:44,496 --> 00:50:45,516
I want to hear

897
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,896
what these bastards are
saying to each other.

898
00:50:46,996 --> 00:50:48,296
This is a 10-digit
control panel.

899
00:50:48,396 --> 00:50:49,386
Six-digit read-out.

900
00:50:49,496 --> 00:50:51,996
Hell, there could be
a million combinations.

901
00:50:52,106 --> 00:50:54,006
Next time you kill one
of these guys,

902
00:50:54,106 --> 00:50:56,036
get him to enter
the code first.

903
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,266
Yeah.

904
00:50:58,406 --> 00:51:00,236
Sir, we just
monitored a call

905
00:51:00,346 --> 00:51:01,936
from their
chief engineer.

906
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:04,606
Our people took out
their S.W.A.T. team completely.

907
00:51:04,716 --> 00:51:06,687
You were right.
They went for the antenna array.

908
00:51:06,787 --> 00:51:07,847
We're right
on schedule.

909
00:51:07,957 --> 00:51:10,917
Losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.

910
00:51:16,297 --> 00:51:18,157
Attention, Dulles Tower.

911
00:51:18,267 --> 00:51:19,957
Attention,
Dulles Control Tower.

912
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:23,127
Mr. Trudeau,
I know you're listening.

913
00:51:23,237 --> 00:51:24,857
Unfortunately,
you're not obeying.

914
00:51:24,967 --> 00:51:26,997
Try me face to face,
and we'll see.

915
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:28,938
You were warned not to try
to restore your systems.

916
00:51:29,038 --> 00:51:30,938
You've wasted lives
and precious time

917
00:51:31,048 --> 00:51:32,838
on a futile
and obvious target.

918
00:51:32,948 --> 00:51:35,678
Now you're going
to pay the penalty.

919
00:51:35,778 --> 00:51:37,978
I've got five dead officers
down here, Colonel Stuart.

920
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:39,808
Isn't that penalty enough?

921
00:51:39,918 --> 00:51:41,288
McClane,
you keep out of this.

922
00:51:41,388 --> 00:51:42,618
You've been
nothing but a pain-

923
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:48,458
Oh, McClane.
John McClane.

924
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:53,799
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

925
00:51:53,899 --> 00:51:56,059
I read about you
in People magazine.

926
00:51:56,169 --> 00:51:58,039
You seemed out of your league
on Nightline, I thought.

927
00:51:58,139 --> 00:51:59,369
Hey, Colonel,
blow me.

928
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:00,699
How much drug money

929
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:03,499
is Esperanza paying you
to turn traitor?

930
00:52:03,609 --> 00:52:05,169
Cardinal Richelieu
said it best.

931
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:07,469
Treason is merely
a matter of dates.

932
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:09,479
This country's got to learn

933
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:11,609
that it can't keep
cutting the legs off

934
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:13,690
of men like
General Esperanza,

935
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,780
men who have the guts
to stand up

936
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,290
against
Communist aggression.

937
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,690
And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?

938
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,700
What's lesson two-
the neutron bomb?

939
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,320
No. I think we can find
something in between.

940
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,270
Watch this.

941
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,741
Give me
a flight number,

942
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:36,671
one that's
low on fuel.

943
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:38,871
Windsor 114.
Transatlantic from London.

944
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:41,951
Fuel tank's
dry as a martini.

945
00:52:42,051 --> 00:52:44,351
Activate the I LS
landing system,

946
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,151
but recalibrate
sea level

947
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:49,821
minus 200 feet.

948
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:15,282
Oh,Jesus!

949
00:53:15,382 --> 00:53:17,682
They've reset ground level
minus 200 feet.

950
00:53:18,853 --> 00:53:20,413
Windsor flight 114.

951
00:53:20,523 --> 00:53:21,723
This is Dulles Approach.

952
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,553
Do you copy?

953
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:26,153
Dulles Approach,
this is Windsor 114.

954
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:27,733
Where the devil
have you been?

955
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,423
Windsor 114.
Dulles Approach.

956
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:32,433
We've been right here
all along, old buddy.

957
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:35,023
Our systems only came back
on line just this very second.

958
00:53:35,143 --> 00:53:39,373
Windsor 114, you are cleared
for ILS approach,

959
00:53:39,473 --> 00:53:40,874
runway two-niner.

960
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,884
Contact Dulles Tower frequency
at the outer marker.

961
00:53:43,984 --> 00:53:44,884
Jesus Christ,

962
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:46,244
he's going to crash
the fucking plane!

963
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:47,914
Roger, Approach,
and about time.

964
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,084
I've got 230 people up here
flying on petrol fumes.

965
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,654
Roger, 114. Understand.

966
00:53:52,754 --> 00:53:54,244
Calibrate Dulles
altimeter...

967
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,294
Oh,Jesus.

968
00:53:55,394 --> 00:53:57,764
They'll fly
right into the concrete.

969
00:53:57,864 --> 00:53:58,884
Son of a bitch!

970
00:53:58,994 --> 00:54:00,964
Why are they
listening to him?

971
00:54:01,064 --> 00:54:02,434
It's our frequency!
Why shouldn't they?

972
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:03,795
Dulles,
this is Windsor 114.

973
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:05,165
Barnes!

974
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,175
This is Dulles Tower.
We have radar contact...

975
00:54:08,275 --> 00:54:10,265
Give me your coat!

976
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,345
Windsor 114, stand by...

977
00:54:12,445 --> 00:54:13,415
What are you
going to do?

978
00:54:13,515 --> 00:54:16,245
Whatever I can.

979
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,145
Ladies and gentlemen,

980
00:54:21,255 --> 00:54:23,275
as you've probably noticed,
we've started our descent.

981
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,226
We're sorry
for the inconvenience,

982
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:28,226
but we'll all be on the ground
in a few minutes. Thank you.

983
00:54:28,326 --> 00:54:30,226
Please keep
your seat belts on.

984
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:31,356
Oh, not to worry.

985
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:33,226
We've made arrangements
for your next flight,

986
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,236
so you won't
miss it, O.K.?

987
00:54:35,336 --> 00:54:36,736
In your seat, please.

988
00:54:36,836 --> 00:54:38,736
Come on, in your seat.

989
00:54:38,836 --> 00:54:39,736
Oh, hey.

990
00:54:39,836 --> 00:54:42,236
We're just like
British Rail, love.

991
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:44,746
We may be late,
but we get you there.

992
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:46,336
Don't worry.

993
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:03,957
Good luck, McClane!

994
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,118
Dulles, this is Windsor 114,

995
00:55:29,228 --> 00:55:31,688
inside the outer marker.

996
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:34,229
Roger, 114.
This is Dulles Tower.

997
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:36,729
We have radar contact
and show you on I LS.

998
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:39,499
You're in the glide path,
and you're looking good.

999
00:55:48,809 --> 00:55:50,299
There's somebody
out there!

1000
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,410
It's McClane.

1001
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,350
Christ.

1002
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,860
Approach flaps.

1003
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,760
Approach flaps.

1004
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,390
Approach speed 140.

1005
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,760
Approach speed 140.

1006
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,490
130.

1007
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,930
Altitude 1,000 feet.

1008
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,100
800, guys!
You're only at 800 feet!

1009
00:56:16,211 --> 00:56:17,371
Fire and Rescue,
this is Cummings.

1010
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:19,501
Roll everything
out to runway two-niner!

1011
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:22,171
Ref speed plus 20.

1012
00:56:22,281 --> 00:56:24,081
600 feet.

1013
00:56:25,321 --> 00:56:26,781
Looking good, Windsor.

1014
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:28,221
Now, watch it.

1015
00:56:28,321 --> 00:56:31,221
30-knot crosswinds,
and the runway is icy.

1016
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,221
Atta boy. We've got you.

1017
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:35,791
We've got you.

1018
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,302
Pull it up!

1019
00:56:51,482 --> 00:56:52,872
Jesus!

1020
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:07,753
Aah! We're going to die!

1021
00:57:07,863 --> 00:57:09,383
We've got you.

1022
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,814
No...

1023
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:37,414
God.

1024
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,824
Motherfucker.

1025
00:57:46,235 --> 00:57:48,325
Motherfucker.

1026
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:53,805
Oh,Jesus.

1027
00:58:04,955 --> 00:58:06,855
That concludes
our object lesson

1028
00:58:06,955 --> 00:58:08,356
for this evening.

1029
00:58:08,456 --> 00:58:11,756
If the 747 we requested
is ready on time

1030
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:14,266
and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested,

1031
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,266
further lessons
can be avoided.

1032
00:58:16,366 --> 00:58:17,626
Out.

1033
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:06,738
We got no sign
of survivors down here.

1034
00:59:06,848 --> 00:59:08,338
It's a goddamn nightmare.

1035
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,588
Hey, Nelson!
Come here.

1036
00:59:22,569 --> 00:59:23,799
Barnes!

1037
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:26,369
We've got to
warn those planes

1038
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:28,299
there's a lunatic
down here.

1039
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:30,429
Get up to the cabin.
Get me on the air.

1040
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:31,439
How?

1041
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:32,879
You figure it out!

1042
00:59:32,979 --> 00:59:34,409
Here's the manifest.

1043
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,830
McClane, I know
how you must feel.

1044
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:05,441
I wanted to help
those people.

1045
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:10,081
I was pretty
goddamn useless.

1046
01:00:12,851 --> 01:00:15,251
We called
the government for help.

1047
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:19,191
They're going to send in
a special Army unit,

1048
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:21,282
a counterterrorist team.

1049
01:00:28,302 --> 01:00:31,202
Your wife's plane?

1050
01:00:31,312 --> 01:00:32,602
Well, they're
still broadcasting

1051
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,072
even though
we can't answer them.

1052
01:00:37,082 --> 01:00:40,142
They're going to run out of fuel
in 90 minutes.

1053
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:53,223
Listen, Dick.

1054
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,063
That is your name?

1055
01:00:55,163 --> 01:00:56,253
Dick.

1056
01:00:56,363 --> 01:00:58,233
If you're going to continue
to get this close,

1057
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,233
do you think
you might consider

1058
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:01,703
switching
after-shaves?

1059
01:01:02,843 --> 01:01:05,034
Anything else?

1060
01:01:05,144 --> 01:01:08,204
Stronger mouthwash
might be nice.

1061
01:01:08,314 --> 01:01:09,404
And here's Sam Coleman

1062
01:01:09,514 --> 01:01:11,244
reporting live
from the site of the accident.

1063
01:01:11,354 --> 01:01:12,404
Well, Colonel,

1064
01:01:12,514 --> 01:01:14,244
they've done everything
we've anticipated...

1065
01:01:14,354 --> 01:01:15,754
so far.

1066
01:01:15,854 --> 01:01:17,984
But still there has been
no official word.

1067
01:01:18,094 --> 01:01:20,184
Meanwhile, despite the fact

1068
01:01:20,294 --> 01:01:23,194
only one runway has been
closed due to the tragedy,

1069
01:01:23,294 --> 01:01:26,094
several dozen airliners are
visible from where I stand,

1070
01:01:26,194 --> 01:01:27,595
endlessly
circling the field.

1071
01:01:27,695 --> 01:01:30,195
Other reports say that
there was trouble in the tower

1072
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:31,705
before the crash

1073
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:33,565
and that that may have even
contributed to it.

1074
01:01:33,675 --> 01:01:34,765
One thing is certain.

1075
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,235
With weather conditions
worsening,

1076
01:01:36,345 --> 01:01:38,245
the problem here
and in the sky above us

1077
01:01:38,345 --> 01:01:39,745
will continue to grow.

1078
01:01:39,845 --> 01:01:43,145
I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles
International Airport.

1079
01:01:50,186 --> 01:01:51,156
Victor. Victor.

1080
01:01:51,256 --> 01:01:52,156
Victor.

1081
01:01:52,256 --> 01:01:53,316
Yeah, what's up?

1082
01:01:53,426 --> 01:01:54,756
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot,

1083
01:01:54,866 --> 01:01:56,256
or did you put them
in your carry-on?

1084
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:57,416
Are you crazy?

1085
01:01:57,526 --> 01:01:58,926
I wouldn't let those assholes
check them in.

1086
01:01:59,036 --> 01:02:00,256
I love you.

1087
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:02,356
Give me one
of the receivers.

1088
01:02:06,376 --> 01:02:09,776
Can you tune in
to the cockpit frequency?

1089
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:11,277
Yeah. Why?

1090
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:14,107
I want to hear
what's going on.

1091
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:18,247
Should be right here
on our band.

1092
01:02:18,357 --> 01:02:19,687
Nothing.

1093
01:02:19,787 --> 01:02:20,687
You just told me
it would work.

1094
01:02:20,787 --> 01:02:21,687
Is it working
or not working?

1095
01:02:21,787 --> 01:02:22,687
It is working,
but it's-

1096
01:02:22,787 --> 01:02:23,777
All I'm getting

1097
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:26,287
is some kind
of airport beacon.

1098
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:27,287
It's weird.

1099
01:02:27,397 --> 01:02:30,227
It's like the tower
isn't there.

1100
01:02:31,897 --> 01:02:33,388
Stay on it.

1101
01:02:34,638 --> 01:02:36,828
Let me know when there is
something there.

1102
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:38,238
O.K.

1103
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:18,280
Major Grant.
We're Blue Light.

1104
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,280
Rollins, Department
ofJustice.

1105
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,280
Trudeau, Chief
of Air Operations.

1106
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:23,650
Lorenzo,
Terminal Police.

1107
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,650
You want something,
you got it.

1108
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,720
This is it?

1109
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,760
One fucking platoon?

1110
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:31,230
One Crisis-1 Platoon.
Who are you?

1111
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,420
John McClane.

1112
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,330
McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.

1113
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:36,330
Yeah.

1114
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,830
Now show some
good sense.

1115
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,531
Let the pros
handle this.

1116
01:03:40,641 --> 01:03:42,301
Yeah, well,
it looks like

1117
01:03:42,411 --> 01:03:43,811
the pros are on
the wrong team tonight.

1118
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:45,141
Isn't Colonel Stuart
one of your men?

1119
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:46,801
No, not anymore,
he's not.

1120
01:03:46,911 --> 01:03:47,811
Now we're here

1121
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,001
to take Colonel
Stuart down.

1122
01:03:49,111 --> 01:03:51,341
And we will
take him down.

1123
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:52,811
You see,
I served with him.

1124
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:54,611
I taught him
everything he knows.

1125
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,311
Well, maybe
he's learned

1126
01:03:56,421 --> 01:03:58,451
a few more things
since then.

1127
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:00,951
Let's hustle!

1128
01:04:01,061 --> 01:04:02,752
The command post
will be set up

1129
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:04,262
in the airport
police station.

1130
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:06,262
I want to be
tied in to the tower

1131
01:04:06,362 --> 01:04:07,262
in 15 minutes.

1132
01:04:07,362 --> 01:04:09,362
All right,
let's do it!

1133
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,032
Hey, Trudeau.

1134
01:04:13,542 --> 01:04:16,372
Did things just get
better or worse?

1135
01:04:20,782 --> 01:04:22,712
Lights-
big, portable lights.

1136
01:04:22,812 --> 01:04:24,873
We set up the field,
and then we-

1137
01:04:24,983 --> 01:04:26,043
We wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out.

1138
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:28,213
And where do we get
those big, portable lights-

1139
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:29,223
Borrow them
from Batman?

1140
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,223
What about
the airphone idea?

1141
01:04:31,323 --> 01:04:32,223
There's 18 planes
up there.

1142
01:04:32,323 --> 01:04:34,123
Only five of them
have those phones.

1143
01:04:34,223 --> 01:04:35,123
We got through
to three of them.

1144
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:36,593
We're still trying
on the others.

1145
01:04:36,693 --> 01:04:38,423
That leaves 13 accidents
waiting to happen.

1146
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:39,433
Are they still
bucking head winds?

1147
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:40,433
I just checked
the weather.

1148
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:41,593
Head winds are
slamming everybody

1149
01:04:41,703 --> 01:04:42,603
over the outer marker.

1150
01:04:42,703 --> 01:04:43,763
The planes
with enough fuel

1151
01:04:43,873 --> 01:04:45,773
have already been
shunted to Atlanta,

1152
01:04:45,873 --> 01:04:47,274
Memphis, and Nashville.

1153
01:04:47,374 --> 01:04:49,104
Outer marker.

1154
01:04:49,214 --> 01:04:51,114
Damn!

1155
01:04:51,214 --> 01:04:52,774
The outer marker!

1156
01:04:52,884 --> 01:04:54,284
It's a beacon, right?

1157
01:04:54,384 --> 01:04:56,284
It sends out this
"beep beep beep"

1158
01:04:56,384 --> 01:04:57,944
so they know they're
over it, right?

1159
01:04:58,054 --> 01:04:59,284
So?

1160
01:04:59,384 --> 01:05:00,374
So who says
that radio signal

1161
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:01,424
has to just beep?

1162
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:02,784
Right.
We switch the frequency

1163
01:05:02,894 --> 01:05:04,254
from the tower
over to the one in the beacon.

1164
01:05:04,354 --> 01:05:06,124
We pump up the wattage.

1165
01:05:06,224 --> 01:05:07,194
And we can talk
to our planes,

1166
01:05:07,294 --> 01:05:08,194
and those bastards
who did this

1167
01:05:08,294 --> 01:05:09,285
will never know!

1168
01:05:12,835 --> 01:05:14,235
Traced the signal.

1169
01:05:14,335 --> 01:05:15,805
Found it in
the luggage area.

1170
01:05:15,905 --> 01:05:16,805
They've been tapped in

1171
01:05:16,905 --> 01:05:18,565
to your tower chatter
all night.

1172
01:05:18,675 --> 01:05:20,665
Punks stealing luggage,
huh, Carmine?

1173
01:05:24,345 --> 01:05:25,745
How you doing,
Telford?

1174
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:26,745
No good.

1175
01:05:26,845 --> 01:05:27,745
I called Lang.

1176
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:29,245
They're rigging
a portable decoder.

1177
01:05:29,355 --> 01:05:30,515
It'll be here
in two hours.

1178
01:05:30,615 --> 01:05:32,246
My wife doesn't
have two hours.

1179
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:34,756
I was only transferred
to Grant's team yesterday.

1180
01:05:34,856 --> 01:05:36,756
The regular guy
got appendicitis.

1181
01:05:36,856 --> 01:05:39,696
Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

1182
01:05:39,796 --> 01:05:41,096
Attention!

1183
01:05:41,196 --> 01:05:43,756
Except maybe
Colonel Stuart.

1184
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:45,766
I want to hear about

1185
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:48,026
the plane
those bastards asked for.

1186
01:05:48,136 --> 01:05:49,336
Then I'll fill you in
on my orders.

1187
01:05:49,436 --> 01:05:51,266
Pilots' briefing room.
Now.

1188
01:05:51,376 --> 01:05:52,276
Keep working.

1189
01:05:52,376 --> 01:05:54,347
Albertson.
With me.

1190
01:05:59,087 --> 01:06:01,107
No civilians.

1191
01:06:11,897 --> 01:06:13,657
What the fuck?

1192
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:15,788
What is it?

1193
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:17,728
The outer marker beeper.

1194
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:20,998
It isn't beeping.
It's talking.

1195
01:06:21,108 --> 01:06:23,238
Attention all aircraft
in Dulles landing pattern.

1196
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:25,398
This is Chief Engineer
Leslie Barnes.

1197
01:06:25,508 --> 01:06:28,238
I have been authorized
to brief you in full.

1198
01:06:28,348 --> 01:06:32,748
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

1199
01:06:32,848 --> 01:06:35,248
Here is the situation.

1200
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,589
Approximately two hours ago...

1201
01:06:40,359 --> 01:06:42,259
Wait until you
get a load of this.

1202
01:06:42,359 --> 01:06:44,759
Do not accept any instructions
claiming to be from our tower

1203
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:47,459
unless you hear your own
flight recoder access code.

1204
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:48,629
The terrorists
have got all...

1205
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:49,629
Holy shit!

1206
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:50,629
our systems and now...

1207
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:51,999
Get this on tape!

1208
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:53,629
have control of everything
except this channel.

1209
01:06:53,739 --> 01:06:55,169
Give us a second
here, please.

1210
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:57,769
This channel is secure.
Your own transmissions are not.

1211
01:06:57,879 --> 01:07:00,780
Do not, repeat,
do not attempt

1212
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,640
to reply on
your own frequencies

1213
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:03,940
to this broadcast.

1214
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,110
These people have already
caused one crash

1215
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,240
by impersonating our tower.

1216
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:08,340
Jesus.

1217
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,390
Repeat. The terrorists
have cut off

1218
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,231
the two systems that can
allow you to land-

1219
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:26,241
field lights
for a visual landing

1220
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:28,241
and the ILS
for an instrument.

1221
01:07:28,341 --> 01:07:31,241
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here

1222
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:32,611
and preparing to take out
the terrorists.

1223
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:33,741
My God.

1224
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:35,041
Don't accept
any instructions...

1225
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,241
Yo, Marvin.

1226
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:38,251
Hey, you interested
in a nice coat?

1227
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:39,751
No. It never looked
good on me anyway.

1228
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:41,411
Listen, you've
got to get me

1229
01:07:41,521 --> 01:07:42,551
up to the pilots'
briefing room.

1230
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:46,252
I've got to hear
what they're saying.

1231
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:47,762
Which one of these maps
gets me in there?

1232
01:07:47,862 --> 01:07:48,762
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

1233
01:07:48,862 --> 01:07:49,762
Find the map,
Marvin.

1234
01:07:49,862 --> 01:07:50,922
I'll find it.

1235
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:52,762
You'll mess up my whole
damn filing system here.

1236
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:54,272
Let's see.
Pilots' Briefing Room.

1237
01:07:54,372 --> 01:07:56,102
I think that's
in the main terminal,

1238
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:59,972
so would that be under
"P" for Pilots' Briefing Room?

1239
01:08:00,072 --> 01:08:01,442
Or maybe it would be

1240
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:04,012
under " M"
for Miscellaneous.

1241
01:08:08,113 --> 01:08:09,413
Oh, shit!

1242
01:08:09,523 --> 01:08:11,453
Request permission
to reduce sentry duty

1243
01:08:11,553 --> 01:08:13,083
to 30-minute rotation.

1244
01:08:13,193 --> 01:08:15,153
My men are getting cold
and antsy. Over.

1245
01:08:15,263 --> 01:08:16,593
This is Colonel Stuart.

1246
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:19,183
Have the men not on watch
assemble for a briefing.

1247
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:20,193
Roger, Colonel.

1248
01:08:20,293 --> 01:08:21,453
What's the matter?

1249
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:24,223
Oh...

1250
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,733
Gentlemen...

1251
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,234
Tonight, the pattern ends.

1252
01:08:29,344 --> 01:08:31,804
The dominoes
will fall no more,

1253
01:08:31,914 --> 01:08:33,434
and the ramparts
will remain upright.

1254
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:35,034
Sir, General
Esperanza's plane

1255
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,944
just came
on the scope.

1256
01:08:44,054 --> 01:08:45,484
Attention, Dulles Tower.

1257
01:08:45,594 --> 01:08:47,824
We will be
lighting up a runway.

1258
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:51,455
Do not, repeat, do not
attempt to land any planes.

1259
01:08:51,565 --> 01:08:54,465
Remember,
we're monitoring you.

1260
01:08:57,365 --> 01:08:58,855
What do we do?

1261
01:08:59,975 --> 01:09:01,065
Obey.

1262
01:09:07,215 --> 01:09:10,805
Dulles Tower
to Fox Trot Michael One.

1263
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:12,645
Dulles Tower
to Fox Trot Michael One.

1264
01:09:12,756 --> 01:09:14,486
This is Fox Trot
Michael One, Dulles.

1265
01:09:14,586 --> 01:09:16,016
We read you. Over.

1266
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:18,486
Fox Trot Michael One,
you are to come in

1267
01:09:18,596 --> 01:09:21,996
on runway 1-5,
repeat, 1-5.

1268
01:09:35,907 --> 01:09:37,937
I found it on the floor,
by the coat,

1269
01:09:38,047 --> 01:09:39,947
next to
the luggage belt.

1270
01:09:40,047 --> 01:09:42,447
What the hell you so excited
about that for?

1271
01:09:42,547 --> 01:09:43,987
The code's still punched
into this one.

1272
01:09:44,087 --> 01:09:45,447
You like it, huh?

1273
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:47,647
How about giving me
20 bucks for it?

1274
01:09:47,757 --> 01:09:49,947
How about
I let you live?

1275
01:09:51,557 --> 01:09:53,617
Man knows how
to bargain.

1276
01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:56,127
This is contrary
to our instructions.

1277
01:09:56,227 --> 01:09:59,028
We are to land
at runway 1-0,

1278
01:09:59,138 --> 01:10:00,118
where we are
to be met

1279
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,998
by representatives
of your justice de-

1280
01:10:03,108 --> 01:10:04,968
Captain, please
tell the tower

1281
01:10:05,078 --> 01:10:07,508
you will proceed
as ordered.

1282
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,749
Roger, Dulles.

1283
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:23,419
Proceeding
to runway 1-5.

1284
01:10:39,339 --> 01:10:41,440
Foxtrot Michael One.
Come in, please.

1285
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,450
What are you
going to do now?

1286
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:45,950
Are you going
to shoot me?

1287
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:47,380
So who will
fly the plane?

1288
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,950
Don't worry about it.

1289
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,780
It's not your problem.

1290
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:58,920
Michael One.
Do you copy?

1291
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,371
Foxtrot Michael One.
Come in, please.

1292
01:11:14,081 --> 01:11:15,571
Eagle Nest.

1293
01:11:15,681 --> 01:11:17,481
This is Falcon.
Mayday.

1294
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:20,521
Eagle Nest.
This is Falcon. Mayday!

1295
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:23,981
Go ahead, Falcon.

1296
01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:27,152
I've lost cabin pressure.
Near zero visibility.

1297
01:11:27,262 --> 01:11:30,122
I must drop out
of this weather and land now,

1298
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:32,132
on the first
accessible runway.

1299
01:11:32,232 --> 01:11:33,532
Repeat.

1300
01:11:33,632 --> 01:11:36,532
I've lost cabin pressure.
Near zero visibility.

1301
01:11:36,632 --> 01:11:38,602
I must drop out
of the storm.

1302
01:11:38,702 --> 01:11:40,932
I can land,
but I must land now,

1303
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:43,102
on the first
outgoing runway.

1304
01:11:43,212 --> 01:11:45,972
Repeat. I cannot
circle around

1305
01:11:46,082 --> 01:11:47,542
to runway 1-5.

1306
01:11:51,053 --> 01:11:52,953
I'll make you
a deal, Marvin.

1307
01:11:53,053 --> 01:11:54,953
You show me a shortcut
out to those runways,

1308
01:11:55,053 --> 01:11:56,423
and I'll get you
a liner for that coat.

1309
01:11:56,523 --> 01:11:59,683
Repeat. I cannot circle around
to runway 1-5.

1310
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:00,693
Shit.

1311
01:12:00,793 --> 01:12:02,023
Stand by, Falcon.

1312
01:12:04,063 --> 01:12:04,963
Here, sir.

1313
01:12:05,063 --> 01:12:06,723
He's coming in
from the ocean.

1314
01:12:09,073 --> 01:12:11,474
A bullet
has damaged my instruments.

1315
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:13,474
I'm not sure
of my bearings,

1316
01:12:13,574 --> 01:12:15,874
and I must make
a visual landing immediately.

1317
01:12:15,974 --> 01:12:17,464
Do you copy, Eagle Nest?

1318
01:12:17,574 --> 01:12:18,774
Roger, Falcon.

1319
01:12:18,884 --> 01:12:20,714
That would be
2-5 right.

1320
01:12:20,814 --> 01:12:22,974
Repeat. 2-5 right.

1321
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:26,314
Make up
your fucking mind!

1322
01:12:26,424 --> 01:12:29,324
Oh, we are just up to our ass
in terrorists again,John.

1323
01:12:29,424 --> 01:12:30,854
Affirmative.
2-5 right. Over.

1324
01:12:30,954 --> 01:12:32,355
2-5 right.

1325
01:12:34,865 --> 01:12:36,025
I've got to quit
smoking cigarettes.

1326
01:12:37,595 --> 01:12:39,535
Thank you for telling me,
Eagle Nest.

1327
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,825
But if you could
show it to me as well,

1328
01:12:41,935 --> 01:12:43,595
I would be grateful.

1329
01:12:54,285 --> 01:12:55,686
I see the lights.

1330
01:12:55,786 --> 01:12:58,016
They are directly
in front of me.

1331
01:12:58,116 --> 01:12:59,516
Gracias, compadre.

1332
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:02,526
Reducing air speed.
Approaching runway.

1333
01:13:02,626 --> 01:13:04,026
Wish me luck.

1334
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:05,616
Roger, Falcon.

1335
01:13:06,796 --> 01:13:09,166
We copy. We'll have you
in five minutes.

1336
01:13:09,266 --> 01:13:10,666
That's right, asshole.

1337
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:12,466
We'll have you
in five minutes.

1338
01:13:36,097 --> 01:13:37,997
I see your lights.

1339
01:13:38,097 --> 01:13:39,658
ETA 90 seconds.

1340
01:13:48,608 --> 01:13:51,078
Come to papa, scumbag.

1341
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,380
Uhh!

1342
01:14:46,371 --> 01:14:47,561
Oh, shit!

1343
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:50,091
Unh! Oh.

1344
01:14:58,481 --> 01:14:59,881
No!

1345
01:15:47,763 --> 01:15:49,023
Freedom.

1346
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:52,064
Not yet.

1347
01:15:54,004 --> 01:15:55,494
You're supposed
to stay in your seat

1348
01:15:55,604 --> 01:15:57,004
until the plane
reaches the terminal.

1349
01:15:57,104 --> 01:15:59,704
No frequent-flier
mileage for you.

1350
01:15:59,814 --> 01:16:00,904
Who are you?

1351
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:02,074
A cop.

1352
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:03,074
A cop?

1353
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:04,074
Yeah, one of
the good guys.

1354
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,804
You're one of
the bad guys,

1355
01:16:05,914 --> 01:16:07,504
and now that I got
your sorry ass,

1356
01:16:07,614 --> 01:16:08,714
I'm going to trade it
for my wife.

1357
01:16:17,965 --> 01:16:18,955
Sit down!

1358
01:16:22,465 --> 01:16:24,495
Go in!

1359
01:16:30,175 --> 01:16:31,075
Where did he go?

1360
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:32,165
In there.

1361
01:16:42,386 --> 01:16:43,286
I don't believe this.

1362
01:16:43,386 --> 01:16:44,986
Two months
of planning,

1363
01:16:45,086 --> 01:16:46,986
and you can't anticipate
one pendejo of a cop.

1364
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:47,986
Come on, General.

1365
01:16:48,096 --> 01:16:49,496
Where the hell
is Colonel Stuart?

1366
01:16:53,596 --> 01:16:54,496
General!

1367
01:16:54,596 --> 01:16:55,756
Ah! I'm all right.

1368
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:57,996
He said he was
a policeman.

1369
01:16:58,106 --> 01:16:59,867
I thought you had
this place secured.

1370
01:16:59,977 --> 01:17:01,997
He went in the cockpit.

1371
01:17:02,107 --> 01:17:03,977
He's going to hell!

1372
01:17:04,107 --> 01:17:05,207
McClane!

1373
01:17:05,307 --> 01:17:09,007
I assume
it's you, McClane.

1374
01:17:09,117 --> 01:17:11,517
You're quite
a little soldier.

1375
01:17:11,617 --> 01:17:15,607
You can consider this
a military funeral!

1376
01:17:31,308 --> 01:17:33,538
Aah!

1377
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:41,048
How many grenades
we got?

1378
01:17:41,148 --> 01:17:43,309
Three each!

1379
01:17:43,419 --> 01:17:44,479
Use them!

1380
01:17:54,599 --> 01:17:55,929
Oh, my-

1381
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,340
Go!

1382
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:28,961
Aah!

1383
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:30,621
Oh, shit!

1384
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:41,481
You lucky fuck.

1385
01:18:44,851 --> 01:18:46,011
Fire trucks, sir.

1386
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:49,081
Fall back
to the church. Now!

1387
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:13,133
Where's the fucking door?

1388
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:29,463
They're getting a little
nervous back there.

1389
01:19:29,563 --> 01:19:30,963
In fact, so am I.

1390
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:32,463
We're right over
Washington.

1391
01:19:32,563 --> 01:19:33,763
See if you
can get any TV.

1392
01:19:33,863 --> 01:19:34,834
That will
settle them down.

1393
01:19:34,934 --> 01:19:37,804
Works for me.
I'll-

1394
01:20:00,995 --> 01:20:02,395
Writing
your acceptance speech

1395
01:20:02,495 --> 01:20:04,395
for the Video Sleaze
Awards?

1396
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:05,985
Try Pulitzer.

1397
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:07,435
Ladies and gentlemen,

1398
01:20:07,535 --> 01:20:10,025
while waiting to land,
our cabin attendants

1399
01:20:10,135 --> 01:20:11,335
are turning on
local Washington broadcasting.

1400
01:20:11,435 --> 01:20:13,375
The sound is on channel three.

1401
01:20:20,046 --> 01:20:20,946
O.K.

1402
01:20:21,046 --> 01:20:22,676
O.K., O.K.

1403
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:33,456
Please, sir, we may
land at any moment.

1404
01:20:33,566 --> 01:20:34,966
If you'll
take your seat-

1405
01:20:35,066 --> 01:20:36,466
I'm going to be sick.

1406
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:37,866
Excuse me.
I'm going to be sick.

1407
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,056
Sir, the seat belt
light is on.

1408
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:45,377
Moron.

1409
01:20:45,477 --> 01:20:46,377
WZDC.

1410
01:20:46,477 --> 01:20:47,407
Yes, this is
Richard Thornberg.

1411
01:20:47,507 --> 01:20:48,637
Put me through to Ruben
in the newsroom.

1412
01:20:48,747 --> 01:20:49,977
Uh, he's
about to go live.

1413
01:20:50,077 --> 01:20:51,477
I know he's
about to go on.

1414
01:20:51,577 --> 01:20:52,977
That's why I need him.

1415
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:54,477
You'll have to hold on-

1416
01:20:54,587 --> 01:20:55,987
Put me through, Celia,

1417
01:20:56,087 --> 01:20:57,717
or start typing
your resume.

1418
01:20:57,817 --> 01:20:59,102
Esperanza's down-

1419
01:20:59,137 --> 01:21:00,387
Esperanza's down-

1420
01:21:00,487 --> 01:21:02,477
But he's hurt.

1421
01:21:02,597 --> 01:21:04,498
He took a round
in his shoulder.

1422
01:21:04,598 --> 01:21:06,498
Plus I got
one more of their guys.

1423
01:21:06,598 --> 01:21:08,288
That's six
they lost altogether.

1424
01:21:08,398 --> 01:21:09,988
Maybe if we knew how many
they had to start with,

1425
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,328
we could get excited,

1426
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:12,558
but if they got 50 guys,

1427
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:15,138
it's a little early
to break out the champagne!

1428
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:16,668
Now, we appreciate
your effort, McClane,

1429
01:21:16,778 --> 01:21:19,178
but we don't need
a loose cannon on this deck!

1430
01:21:19,278 --> 01:21:20,438
What if they decide
to crash another plane

1431
01:21:20,548 --> 01:21:22,448
in retaliation
for your little stunt?

1432
01:21:22,548 --> 01:21:24,448
They can't do that
anymore, right, Barnes?

1433
01:21:24,548 --> 01:21:26,449
Besides, if I
grabbed Esperanza,

1434
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:27,809
this would
all be over by now.

1435
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:29,439
Well, maybe they're just
a little bit more creative

1436
01:21:29,559 --> 01:21:30,539
than you think!

1437
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:32,919
Well, at least
I'm thinking, goddamn it!

1438
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:34,459
Listen, you wise-ass,

1439
01:21:34,559 --> 01:21:35,619
we're here to jerk off
that cocksucker

1440
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:36,749
until he tries
to take off.

1441
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:37,759
Period!

1442
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:39,459
Now, you're the wrong guy

1443
01:21:39,569 --> 01:21:40,959
in the wrong place
at the wrong time!

1444
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:44,869
The story of my life.

1445
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:47,009
Major,

1446
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,510
Pentagon situation room,
sir!

1447
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:49,510
Pentagon.

1448
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,510
I'll take it
in here.

1449
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:52,670
Thank you, Telford.

1450
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,510
You men
come with me.

1451
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,980
McClane.

1452
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:58,980
Yeah, Barnes.

1453
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:00,480
You said those guys

1454
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:01,950
showed up out there
right away?

1455
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:03,150
Yeah.

1456
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,020
That means they're
on the field or close,

1457
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,520
and I think
I know where.

1458
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,561
Come here. Let me
show you something.

1459
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:12,531
These are the old plans

1460
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:14,531
when the longer
runways went in.

1461
01:22:14,631 --> 01:22:16,001
That's 12 years ago.

1462
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:18,541
Looks like they've done
some modifications on site-

1463
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:20,541
moved Tra Con phones, I LS,

1464
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:22,041
all the underground stuff

1465
01:22:22,141 --> 01:22:24,041
so they could
handle drainage.

1466
01:22:24,141 --> 01:22:25,541
If I'm right,

1467
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:28,041
all of it would run
right along the airport property

1468
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:31,241
and go right past
this neighborhood.

1469
01:22:34,052 --> 01:22:36,042
We should have been
on the ground two hours ago!

1470
01:22:36,162 --> 01:22:39,062
I understand,
but if you just relax...

1471
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:41,062
It's hopeless.

1472
01:22:41,162 --> 01:22:43,062
Somebody ought to get
their ass kicked for this mess,

1473
01:22:43,162 --> 01:22:45,362
that's for sure.

1474
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:46,692
Well, unfortunately,

1475
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:49,062
there really isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

1476
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:52,072
Oh, yeah? What about
that porker Willard Scott?

1477
01:22:52,172 --> 01:22:54,073
I should have
taken the bus.

1478
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:57,073
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

1479
01:22:57,183 --> 01:22:58,273
Excuse me.

1480
01:22:58,383 --> 01:23:00,243
Yes?

1481
01:23:00,353 --> 01:23:01,753
I was just wondering.

1482
01:23:01,853 --> 01:23:03,253
This flight originally

1483
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:06,583
was supposed to be
51/2 hours, right?

1484
01:23:06,693 --> 01:23:07,583
Mm-hmm.

1485
01:23:07,693 --> 01:23:08,853
Do we have
enough fuel

1486
01:23:08,953 --> 01:23:10,083
to keep circling
like this?

1487
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:11,423
Oh, of course.

1488
01:23:11,523 --> 01:23:14,553
They anticipate
little problems like this.

1489
01:23:31,484 --> 01:23:33,314
Barnes, we looked
at 12 fucking houses,

1490
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:34,744
and we're nowhere.

1491
01:23:34,854 --> 01:23:37,654
This is
our last possibility.

1492
01:23:37,754 --> 01:23:39,815
Over here there's
an old church.

1493
01:23:39,925 --> 01:23:41,555
Let's go.

1494
01:23:45,665 --> 01:23:47,155
Wait.

1495
01:23:54,175 --> 01:23:56,665
There's the church
over there.

1496
01:24:04,216 --> 01:24:06,306
Could be a sentry.

1497
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,046
And he could just be
out for a walk.

1498
01:24:08,156 --> 01:24:10,626
Then why is he going over
his own footsteps?

1499
01:24:13,226 --> 01:24:14,246
Come on.

1500
01:24:16,496 --> 01:24:17,626
All right.

1501
01:24:17,726 --> 01:24:20,456
Just stay here and get ready
to call the marines.

1502
01:24:20,566 --> 01:24:22,196
I thought
they were the army.

1503
01:24:22,296 --> 01:24:24,857
Who gives a fuck?
Just be ready.

1504
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:43,217
Oh, shit.

1505
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:45,418
Not now.

1506
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:49,218
Aah!

1507
01:24:59,638 --> 01:25:01,078
Lorenzo, it's Barnes.

1508
01:25:01,178 --> 01:25:03,078
Barnes, where the hell
did you go?

1509
01:25:03,178 --> 01:25:04,078
Where's McClane?

1510
01:25:04,178 --> 01:25:05,108
He's with me.

1511
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:06,308
We're at the Hidey Lake
Community Church

1512
01:25:06,418 --> 01:25:07,349
on the west side
of the airport.

1513
01:25:07,449 --> 01:25:09,079
You're where?
Goddamn it!

1514
01:25:09,179 --> 01:25:10,579
You crazy idiot,
why didn't-

1515
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,089
This must be their
base of operations.

1516
01:25:12,189 --> 01:25:13,589
Shut up and get
your ass over here!

1517
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:14,589
Move it!

1518
01:25:14,689 --> 01:25:16,089
Code red! Sit rep.

1519
01:25:16,189 --> 01:25:18,519
We got positive I.D.
on Stuart's location.

1520
01:25:18,629 --> 01:25:19,529
Let's move.

1521
01:25:19,629 --> 01:25:21,489
Yo!

1522
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,870
Our escape plane
will be ready

1523
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:35,540
within 30 minutes,
General.

1524
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,410
If there are
no more surprises.

1525
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:56,031
Gentlemen, we have
a situation here.

1526
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:46,143
Aah!

1527
01:26:55,723 --> 01:26:56,713
Oh!

1528
01:27:14,284 --> 01:27:15,474
Over here.

1529
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:30,355
Jeez, McClane, you all right?
You want a medic?

1530
01:27:30,465 --> 01:27:32,295
What the hell you think
you're doing out there,

1531
01:27:32,395 --> 01:27:33,865
playing John Wayne?

1532
01:27:33,965 --> 01:27:36,095
How would you like
to spend the night in a cell?

1533
01:27:36,205 --> 01:27:38,395
Lorenzo, shut the fuck up
and do something useful.

1534
01:27:38,505 --> 01:27:39,695
Go seal off the street.

1535
01:27:39,805 --> 01:27:41,865
Hey, you can't
talk to me like that.

1536
01:27:41,975 --> 01:27:43,276
Oh, no, Carmine?

1537
01:27:43,376 --> 01:27:45,206
Sergeant, get this bureaucrat

1538
01:27:45,316 --> 01:27:47,076
out of Mr. McClane's
face now.

1539
01:27:47,186 --> 01:27:49,046
With pleasure, sir.

1540
01:27:50,816 --> 01:27:52,876
Major...

1541
01:27:52,986 --> 01:27:54,216
the men are
in position, sir.

1542
01:27:54,326 --> 01:27:56,226
Close up the back.
Then we go in.

1543
01:27:56,326 --> 01:27:57,726
Fire only on my order.

1544
01:27:57,826 --> 01:27:59,226
Roger that, sir.

1545
01:27:59,326 --> 01:28:01,196
Guess I was
wrong about you.

1546
01:28:01,296 --> 01:28:03,766
You're not such
an asshole after all.

1547
01:28:03,866 --> 01:28:05,267
No, you were right.

1548
01:28:05,367 --> 01:28:07,337
I'm just your kind
of asshole.

1549
01:28:15,807 --> 01:28:18,477
Garber, sit rep!

1550
01:28:18,577 --> 01:28:20,777
Army Special Forces
on three sides,

1551
01:28:20,887 --> 01:28:22,437
closing in fast
around the back!

1552
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:23,887
Another problem,
Colonel?

1553
01:28:23,987 --> 01:28:25,977
No problem, General.

1554
01:28:26,087 --> 01:28:29,078
Gentlemen,
you know what to do.

1555
01:28:39,838 --> 01:28:40,738
Down!

1556
01:28:40,838 --> 01:28:42,168
Get down! Get down!

1557
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:13,800
General... it's time.

1558
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,070
Come on, let's move it!

1559
01:29:37,131 --> 01:29:40,191
They're pulling out
out the back!

1560
01:29:47,441 --> 01:29:49,031
Move it!

1561
01:29:59,592 --> 01:30:02,082
Albertson, take your men
around the back.

1562
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:10,762
Aah!

1563
01:30:15,272 --> 01:30:17,863
Aah!

1564
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:30,213
This equipment,
it could land our planes.

1565
01:30:30,323 --> 01:30:33,013
There were trip wires outside.
They could have booby-trapped-

1566
01:30:33,123 --> 01:30:34,023
They did.

1567
01:30:34,123 --> 01:30:35,093
Got one here, too.

1568
01:30:35,193 --> 01:30:36,753
Looks like C-4.
The motherfucker is armed.

1569
01:30:36,863 --> 01:30:40,154
Clear the area!
Everybody, now!

1570
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:44,694
They booby-trapped
all the equipment.

1571
01:30:44,804 --> 01:30:46,204
Seal off
the building!

1572
01:30:46,304 --> 01:30:47,704
Shit!

1573
01:30:47,804 --> 01:30:49,704
Post sentries.
No civilians allowed.

1574
01:30:49,804 --> 01:30:53,134
Hey, where the fuck
is McClane?

1575
01:31:42,056 --> 01:31:43,526
Miller, take him!

1576
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:48,127
I'll cover you!

1577
01:32:22,768 --> 01:32:27,768
Aah!

1578
01:32:33,849 --> 01:32:37,149
So much
for the element of chance.

1579
01:32:37,249 --> 01:32:38,719
Let's move out.

1580
01:32:46,289 --> 01:32:48,349
Ohh...

1581
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,260
I had the bastard
in my sights.

1582
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,360
I know I did.

1583
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:11,790
Oh,Jesus Christ.

1584
01:33:16,961 --> 01:33:19,221
Attention, Tower.
Attention, Dulles Tower.

1585
01:33:19,331 --> 01:33:22,231
This is Colonel Stuart.
Is our plane prepared?

1586
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:24,231
It is.
It's in hangar 11.

1587
01:33:24,331 --> 01:33:26,531
It's the most
remote building we've got.

1588
01:33:26,641 --> 01:33:29,631
We're on our way.

1589
01:33:29,741 --> 01:33:31,711
Have a ground crew there
to confirm the condition

1590
01:33:31,811 --> 01:33:33,241
of the plane.

1591
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:36,211
Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

1592
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:39,042
Colonel, you're quite capable of
confirming it yourself.

1593
01:33:39,152 --> 01:33:41,052
Now, please, don't ask us

1594
01:33:41,152 --> 01:33:43,242
to gift-wrap potential
hostages for you.

1595
01:33:43,352 --> 01:33:44,752
Major Grant,
isn't it?

1596
01:33:44,852 --> 01:33:46,482
If you remember me,
Colonel,

1597
01:33:46,592 --> 01:33:50,122
then you remember I know
the drill as well as you do.

1598
01:33:50,232 --> 01:33:52,252
Check out
your own fucking plane.

1599
01:33:52,362 --> 01:33:54,762
We move out
in five minutes.

1600
01:33:54,862 --> 01:33:56,262
Flak jackets
for everybody.

1601
01:33:56,362 --> 01:33:58,762
Body armor for
the assault team.

1602
01:33:58,872 --> 01:34:00,273
Night scopes
for the snipers.

1603
01:34:00,373 --> 01:34:02,273
We will take them
in the hangar,

1604
01:34:02,373 --> 01:34:04,273
and I will
pull that detonator

1605
01:34:04,373 --> 01:34:07,273
out of Stuart's
dead fucking hand myself.

1606
01:34:07,383 --> 01:34:10,743
Take all your men
back to the airport.

1607
01:34:10,853 --> 01:34:12,253
Seal off every exit

1608
01:34:12,353 --> 01:34:13,783
in case they try
to slip past us

1609
01:34:13,883 --> 01:34:15,783
to break out
onto the ground.

1610
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:17,253
You got it.

1611
01:34:19,293 --> 01:34:21,083
All right,
here we go.

1612
01:34:21,193 --> 01:34:22,384
Dick, this is nuts.

1613
01:34:22,494 --> 01:34:23,724
Every station in town
has people out at the airport,

1614
01:34:23,834 --> 01:34:25,224
and none of them has
heard even a whisper

1615
01:34:25,334 --> 01:34:26,734
of this shit
you're running now!

1616
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:28,664
Well,
none of them is me.

1617
01:34:28,764 --> 01:34:30,424
You want proof,
try this.

1618
01:34:30,534 --> 01:34:33,934
Repeat. Terrorists
have murdered civilians

1619
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:37,034
and cut off the two systems
that can allow you to land.

1620
01:34:37,144 --> 01:34:39,234
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here

1621
01:34:39,344 --> 01:34:40,604
and preparing
to take out the terrorists.

1622
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:41,614
Jesus Christ.

1623
01:34:41,714 --> 01:34:43,745
I want you
to go live now.

1624
01:34:43,855 --> 01:34:45,815
Get me in from the files-
a publicity shot.

1625
01:34:45,915 --> 01:34:47,945
Connie's got one.
The maps-get one from weather.

1626
01:34:48,055 --> 01:34:49,245
We're on it.
We're cutting in five minutes!

1627
01:34:49,355 --> 01:34:50,755
Tell the affiliates
if they want in,

1628
01:34:50,855 --> 01:34:52,255
they got three minutes
to shout.

1629
01:34:52,355 --> 01:34:54,695
Let's do this.

1630
01:34:54,795 --> 01:34:57,285
Network, here I come.

1631
01:35:00,435 --> 01:35:01,405
Hey, Telford,

1632
01:35:01,505 --> 01:35:03,265
what was your
chicken shit outfit doing

1633
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:04,895
while we
were taking Grenada?

1634
01:35:05,005 --> 01:35:06,806
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

1635
01:35:06,906 --> 01:35:09,306
Grenada- five minutes
of fire fight,

1636
01:35:09,406 --> 01:35:12,106
five weeks of surfing.

1637
01:35:12,216 --> 01:35:14,186
I wish I was
with you guys for that.

1638
01:35:14,286 --> 01:35:16,276
Yeah. Me, too, kid.

1639
01:35:16,386 --> 01:35:17,716
Really, sir?

1640
01:35:17,816 --> 01:35:19,516
Sure.

1641
01:35:19,616 --> 01:35:22,286
Then we wouldn't
have to do this.

1642
01:35:37,677 --> 01:35:40,237
Eagle Nest,
this is Hatchling.

1643
01:35:40,347 --> 01:35:44,367
On schedule...
and in position.

1644
01:35:44,477 --> 01:35:46,747
Roger, Hatchling.
We are secure here.

1645
01:35:46,847 --> 01:35:48,747
You have
a green light.

1646
01:35:48,847 --> 01:35:52,578
I repeat, a green light.

1647
01:36:00,368 --> 01:36:01,798
Oh!

1648
01:36:03,368 --> 01:36:05,768
Jesus, Officer,
where did you come from,

1649
01:36:05,868 --> 01:36:07,268
Pearl Harbor?

1650
01:36:07,368 --> 01:36:08,858
Uh!

1651
01:36:11,408 --> 01:36:14,809
All right,
let's clear it out, please.

1652
01:36:15,909 --> 01:36:17,709
Stand by.

1653
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:20,409
5, 4, 3...

1654
01:36:20,519 --> 01:36:24,109
This is a special bulletin
from WZDC News.

1655
01:36:24,219 --> 01:36:25,709
There was a plane crash
earlier this evening at Dulles,

1656
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:27,789
where other aircraft
continue to circle,

1657
01:36:27,889 --> 01:36:30,789
with no explanation from
airport or FAA officials.

1658
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:33,799
And now,
with an exclusive WZDC report,

1659
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:37,730
here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.

1660
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,270
I'm one of the thousand people

1661
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:42,400
who has been circling
our nation's capital

1662
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:44,240
under the assumption
that whatever problem

1663
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:47,140
was going on far below
was a normal one,

1664
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:49,240
but the truth
is far from normal.

1665
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:51,470
The truth is terrifying.

1666
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:54,780
Look out!
Lady, look out!

1667
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:55,820
Look out! Look out!

1668
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,181
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

1669
01:36:58,291 --> 01:36:59,261
Ho!

1670
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:00,261
Get out of the way!

1671
01:37:00,361 --> 01:37:02,451
Get out
of the way, lady!

1672
01:37:02,561 --> 01:37:04,261
Go, go, go!
Hey, hey, look out!

1673
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:06,261
This is a recording
of a conversation

1674
01:37:06,361 --> 01:37:09,531
between Dulles Tower
and a captive aircraft overhead.

1675
01:37:11,801 --> 01:37:13,861
Get out of the way!

1676
01:37:15,611 --> 01:37:16,771
Lorenzo!

1677
01:37:16,881 --> 01:37:18,211
McClane, are you out
of your fucking mind?

1678
01:37:18,311 --> 01:37:20,212
The Blue Light team-
where are they?

1679
01:37:20,312 --> 01:37:21,872
Stuart's got explosives
in the church rigged with a remote.

1680
01:37:21,982 --> 01:37:23,112
Where's Grant?

1681
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:24,552
They're going to kill
that son of a bitch

1682
01:37:24,652 --> 01:37:25,712
and get it from them!

1683
01:37:25,822 --> 01:37:26,912
They're not
going to do that!

1684
01:37:27,022 --> 01:37:28,182
They're going to
get on the same plane with him

1685
01:37:28,292 --> 01:37:29,222
and take off
with him!

1686
01:37:29,322 --> 01:37:30,382
Get the fuck
out of here!

1687
01:37:30,492 --> 01:37:32,392
When the army
canned Stuart,

1688
01:37:32,492 --> 01:37:33,552
he loaded that unit
with his own men!

1689
01:37:33,662 --> 01:37:35,352
Are you nuts?
That fire fight-

1690
01:37:35,462 --> 01:37:36,892
Sideshow to buy
them some time.

1691
01:37:37,002 --> 01:37:40,332
McClane, you are
completely around the fucking bend.

1692
01:37:40,432 --> 01:37:41,803
You're under arrest,
you motherfucker.

1693
01:37:48,273 --> 01:37:49,743
Here! These
are the bullets

1694
01:37:49,843 --> 01:37:51,173
they used
out there tonight!

1695
01:37:51,283 --> 01:37:53,343
Blanks!

1696
01:37:54,853 --> 01:37:57,343
Jesus Christ.

1697
01:38:04,364 --> 01:38:06,984
This is Chief Lorenzo.

1698
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:08,254
I want
every officer recalled

1699
01:38:08,364 --> 01:38:10,264
and assembled in body armor
and full weaponry

1700
01:38:10,364 --> 01:38:12,524
in the motor pool
in five minutes.

1701
01:38:13,834 --> 01:38:17,534
It's time to kick ass.

1702
01:38:19,374 --> 01:38:21,744
Just like IwoJima!

1703
01:38:21,844 --> 01:38:25,044
This reporter has learned
that the terrorists

1704
01:38:25,144 --> 01:38:27,115
have virtual control
of the entire airport,

1705
01:38:27,215 --> 01:38:30,275
a fact that the authorities
have repressed.

1706
01:38:30,385 --> 01:38:32,285
The terrorists
promise more bloodshed

1707
01:38:32,385 --> 01:38:34,585
unless their demands
are met,

1708
01:38:34,695 --> 01:38:36,715
and now that
the Special Army commandos

1709
01:38:36,825 --> 01:38:38,225
have arrived at the airport,

1710
01:38:38,325 --> 01:38:40,225
the likelihood
of a full-scale, deadly battle

1711
01:38:40,335 --> 01:38:42,855
is dangerously close.

1712
01:39:03,116 --> 01:39:06,246
That stupid, arrogant
son of a bitch.

1713
01:39:06,356 --> 01:39:09,156
It's all over the airport.

1714
01:39:09,256 --> 01:39:11,157
300 people have died...

1715
01:39:11,267 --> 01:39:13,667
When are we
going to land?

1716
01:39:13,767 --> 01:39:16,257
...and unfortunately
they may not be the last.

1717
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:18,927
The horrifying fact
is that no one is safe,

1718
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:21,197
either in the planes
above Dulles

1719
01:39:21,307 --> 01:39:23,707
or in the terminal below.

1720
01:39:23,807 --> 01:39:27,207
The threat of a new and higher
body count at the airport

1721
01:39:27,317 --> 01:39:29,217
hangs over the heads
of everyone,

1722
01:39:29,317 --> 01:39:31,217
and the holiday season
of peace and love

1723
01:39:31,317 --> 01:39:33,688
has become a nightmare.

1724
01:39:39,688 --> 01:39:41,088
All right, listen up!

1725
01:39:41,198 --> 01:39:44,218
All units, I want you
to converge on hangar 11,

1726
01:39:44,328 --> 01:39:45,728
all sides!

1727
01:39:45,828 --> 01:39:47,728
This car, McClane!
Get in!

1728
01:39:47,838 --> 01:39:50,598
When the City Blue
show up with their backup,

1729
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:52,228
they'll pick up
the pieces!

1730
01:39:52,338 --> 01:39:54,168
Now, move out!

1731
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:58,209
McClane, say hi
to my brother Vito.

1732
01:39:58,309 --> 01:39:59,869
Merry Christmas.

1733
01:39:59,979 --> 01:40:01,509
Hi.

1734
01:40:08,019 --> 01:40:09,249
Goddamn it
to hell!

1735
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:11,989
Move that
piece of shit!

1736
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:15,119
Will you move
that goddamn piece of shit

1737
01:40:15,229 --> 01:40:16,249
out of here?

1738
01:40:16,359 --> 01:40:17,700
Vito, get the fuck
out of the car

1739
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,700
and get your ass
in gear and help me.

1740
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,100
Will you get-

1741
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,640
Move that car
right now!

1742
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,870
Right there.
Right there. Get that.

1743
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:27,970
Hey, Coleman!

1744
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:32,140
Sam! Sam Coleman!

1745
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:34,480
Hey, Coleman!

1746
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:35,880
Hi!

1747
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:38,420
Coleman!

1748
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,221
But at least the truth
is not among the hostages

1749
01:40:42,321 --> 01:40:45,721
because I, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here

1750
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:50,031
to put his life
and talent

1751
01:40:50,131 --> 01:40:53,001
on the line for humanity
and country,

1752
01:40:53,101 --> 01:40:56,071
and if this should be
my final broadcast-

1753
01:40:58,341 --> 01:41:01,312
Amen to that... Dick.

1754
01:41:01,412 --> 01:41:04,242
Dick? We're live, Dick.

1755
01:41:04,352 --> 01:41:06,402
Where are you now?

1756
01:41:06,512 --> 01:41:08,882
Dick?

1757
01:41:08,982 --> 01:41:10,812
Truck lights
approaching, sir.

1758
01:41:10,922 --> 01:41:14,252
They're here,
right on schedule.

1759
01:41:14,362 --> 01:41:16,762
The hangar door,
open it.

1760
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:18,192
Clockwork.

1761
01:41:41,323 --> 01:41:42,713
Jeez, you
give me this story,

1762
01:41:42,823 --> 01:41:45,224
and I'll
have your baby.

1763
01:41:45,324 --> 01:41:48,154
Not the kind of ride
I'm looking for.

1764
01:41:59,834 --> 01:42:03,244
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

1765
01:42:03,344 --> 01:42:04,744
Thank you, Major.

1766
01:42:04,844 --> 01:42:06,744
You're not
so bad yourself.

1767
01:42:06,844 --> 01:42:08,575
Congratulations
on your escape, sir.

1768
01:42:08,685 --> 01:42:09,735
Thank you, Major.

1769
01:42:09,845 --> 01:42:11,005
Maybe you
should save them

1770
01:42:11,115 --> 01:42:12,175
until we
are all safe, hmm?

1771
01:42:12,285 --> 01:42:13,820
Sir.

1772
01:42:13,855 --> 01:42:15,755
My congratulations,
gentlemen.

1773
01:42:15,855 --> 01:42:17,255
You've won a victory
for our way of life,

1774
01:42:17,355 --> 01:42:21,625
my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.

1775
01:42:21,725 --> 01:42:23,355
Now, get on board.

1776
01:42:52,427 --> 01:42:54,327
What's the matter,
cowboy, ride too rough?

1777
01:42:54,427 --> 01:42:55,827
I don't
like to fly.

1778
01:42:55,927 --> 01:42:57,327
Then what
are you doing here?

1779
01:42:57,437 --> 01:42:59,127
I don't like
to lose, either.

1780
01:42:59,237 --> 01:43:01,667
O.K. Whoo! Here we go!

1781
01:43:09,607 --> 01:43:11,547
I don't know
about you guys,

1782
01:43:11,647 --> 01:43:13,507
but I've seen
enough fucking snow

1783
01:43:13,617 --> 01:43:14,708
to last me
a lifetime.

1784
01:43:14,818 --> 01:43:16,838
You don't get much of that
in the tropics, Major.

1785
01:43:16,948 --> 01:43:19,648
For you, gentlemen,
we'll import it.

1786
01:43:22,688 --> 01:43:24,158
Shit!
They left the hangar!

1787
01:43:27,128 --> 01:43:28,558
Right there.

1788
01:43:28,668 --> 01:43:30,498
Right there.
Get that.

1789
01:43:30,598 --> 01:43:31,498
All right, now what?

1790
01:43:31,598 --> 01:43:32,798
Get in front of them!
Take it down!

1791
01:43:32,898 --> 01:43:34,998
Block their path
so they can't get out of there!

1792
01:43:35,108 --> 01:43:36,599
I'm not playing chicken
with a 200-ton plane!

1793
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:37,969
I'm crazy, man,
but I ain't that crazy.

1794
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:39,129
Forget it.

1795
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:40,799
Dulles,
this is Northeast 140.

1796
01:43:40,909 --> 01:43:42,139
Request clearance
on first available runway.

1797
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:43,339
That's Holly's plane.

1798
01:43:43,449 --> 01:43:45,849
Repeat. Request
emergency clearance.

1799
01:43:45,949 --> 01:43:46,969
I know you're
not going to answer me,

1800
01:43:47,089 --> 01:43:48,209
but you damn well
better listen!

1801
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:50,309
We're down to fumes,
and we have to land,

1802
01:43:50,419 --> 01:43:51,649
and in five minutes
we're coming in

1803
01:43:51,759 --> 01:43:53,159
one way or another.

1804
01:43:53,259 --> 01:43:54,489
That's my wife's
plane!

1805
01:43:54,589 --> 01:43:55,889
Take it
fucking down!

1806
01:43:55,989 --> 01:43:57,429
I'm not getting
in front of that plane!

1807
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:04,920
All right, how about
getting over top of it?

1808
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.

1809
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:07,640
Your attention.

1810
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:08,830
We have no choice

1811
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:11,170
but to attempt
an emergency landing.

1812
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,680
Please fasten your seat belts
and assume crash positions

1813
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:16,180
as instructed
by your cabin attendants.

1814
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,680
Let's have
the emergency check list.

1815
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:21,221
Attention all air traffic
in Dulles area.

1816
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:22,721
This is Northeast 140.

1817
01:44:22,821 --> 01:44:24,341
We're going to attempt
an emergency landing.

1818
01:44:24,461 --> 01:44:25,581
Be advised.

1819
01:44:28,461 --> 01:44:29,861
I don't want to die.

1820
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:31,791
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1821
01:44:31,901 --> 01:44:33,301
Just buckle
your seat belt.

1822
01:44:33,401 --> 01:44:35,301
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1823
01:44:35,401 --> 01:44:36,531
Lean forward.

1824
01:44:37,901 --> 01:44:40,031
God!

1825
01:44:40,141 --> 01:44:42,111
Oh!

1826
01:44:44,982 --> 01:44:46,912
Oh, God.

1827
01:44:47,012 --> 01:44:48,312
O God,

1828
01:44:48,412 --> 01:44:52,212
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me.

1829
01:44:58,392 --> 01:44:59,982
Just hang on!

1830
01:45:00,092 --> 01:45:01,962
What are you doing?

1831
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,032
You wanted a story,
didn't you?

1832
01:45:03,132 --> 01:45:04,122
Nice and easy, boys.

1833
01:45:04,232 --> 01:45:05,323
Get me in low!

1834
01:45:05,433 --> 01:45:06,953
You got it!

1835
01:45:08,873 --> 01:45:10,833
Bring me down!

1836
01:45:10,943 --> 01:45:12,333
You'll get
yourself killed!

1837
01:45:12,443 --> 01:45:14,903
Come back inside!

1838
01:45:21,283 --> 01:45:23,343
Bring it in low!
Keep over the wing!

1839
01:45:30,894 --> 01:45:33,324
Lower!

1840
01:45:33,424 --> 01:45:34,324
Aah!

1841
01:45:42,934 --> 01:45:45,534
John, what the fuck
are you doing

1842
01:45:45,644 --> 01:45:48,614
out on the wing
of this plane?

1843
01:45:53,585 --> 01:45:54,845
Damn!

1844
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:02,215
Mierda.

1845
01:46:02,325 --> 01:46:03,695
There's
something wrong.

1846
01:46:03,795 --> 01:46:06,485
The ailerons.

1847
01:46:06,595 --> 01:46:08,655
We can't
take off.

1848
01:46:11,636 --> 01:46:12,566
Hijo de puta.

1849
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:14,436
It's McClane again.

1850
01:46:16,176 --> 01:46:17,406
Son of a bitch!

1851
01:46:18,506 --> 01:46:21,346
I'll do him.

1852
01:46:21,446 --> 01:46:22,706
This time
do it right.

1853
01:46:22,816 --> 01:46:24,716
You just get us
in the air, General.

1854
01:46:24,816 --> 01:46:26,376
You're the only man
who can do it.

1855
01:46:26,486 --> 01:46:28,276
Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fueled.

1856
01:46:54,377 --> 01:46:55,277
Ya!

1857
01:47:20,909 --> 01:47:23,599
Too bad, McClane.
I kind of liked you!

1858
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:28,649
Whoa!

1859
01:47:31,389 --> 01:47:33,719
I got enough friends!

1860
01:47:36,489 --> 01:47:38,009
Aah!

1861
01:48:10,621 --> 01:48:12,351
O.K., McClane...

1862
01:48:12,461 --> 01:48:13,951
time for
the main event!

1863
01:48:18,971 --> 01:48:20,701
Aah!

1864
01:48:23,071 --> 01:48:23,971
Aah!

1865
01:48:49,833 --> 01:48:51,703
Motherfucker!

1866
01:48:59,513 --> 01:49:00,803
Oh!

1867
01:49:02,283 --> 01:49:03,473
Ha ha ha!

1868
01:49:03,583 --> 01:49:04,543
How's it going?

1869
01:49:08,423 --> 01:49:09,974
Bon voyage!

1870
01:49:16,424 --> 01:49:19,454
Happy landings, asshole!

1871
01:50:09,886 --> 01:50:12,286
Yippie-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

1872
01:50:25,167 --> 01:50:26,827
Yeah. All right.

1873
01:50:41,318 --> 01:50:42,548
Aah!

1874
01:50:46,188 --> 01:50:48,778
Whoa!

1875
01:50:54,368 --> 01:50:57,298
Ha ha ha!

1876
01:50:57,398 --> 01:51:00,269
Oh!

1877
01:51:03,909 --> 01:51:06,809
Holly!

1878
01:51:06,909 --> 01:51:09,309
Here's your fucking
landing light!

1879
01:51:09,409 --> 01:51:10,969
Whoo!

1880
01:51:17,149 --> 01:51:18,819
Oh, God.

1881
01:51:21,059 --> 01:51:22,530
Look!

1882
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:23,520
Look!

1883
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:26,820
O.K., I see it!
I see it!

1884
01:51:50,791 --> 01:51:52,281
They used
the fire to see!

1885
01:51:52,391 --> 01:51:53,721
They used
the fucking fire to see!

1886
01:51:53,821 --> 01:51:55,051
They can all do that.
Tell them.

1887
01:51:55,161 --> 01:51:56,561
They already know.

1888
01:51:56,661 --> 01:51:58,291
We had a visual
on Northeastern's landing.

1889
01:51:58,401 --> 01:51:59,621
Listen.

1890
01:51:59,731 --> 01:52:01,761
We're following the fire trail
in as a guide.

1891
01:52:01,871 --> 01:52:03,091
If they can do it,
so can we!

1892
01:52:20,452 --> 01:52:21,822
Whoo!

1893
01:52:21,922 --> 01:52:23,322
If any landing
you can walk away from

1894
01:52:23,422 --> 01:52:24,752
is a good one,
that's great.

1895
01:52:24,862 --> 01:52:26,382
Whew!

1896
01:52:48,453 --> 01:52:50,353
Oh!

1897
01:52:54,654 --> 01:52:56,354
Jump!

1898
01:52:56,454 --> 01:52:57,854
Jump!

1899
01:52:57,964 --> 01:52:59,354
I got you!

1900
01:52:59,464 --> 01:53:00,514
Jump!

1901
01:53:29,395 --> 01:53:30,985
There you go.
That's it.

1902
01:53:31,095 --> 01:53:33,615
There he is!

1903
01:53:33,795 --> 01:53:34,925
That's it!

1904
01:53:36,436 --> 01:53:39,836
Holly!

1905
01:53:42,936 --> 01:53:46,276
Holly!

1906
01:53:46,376 --> 01:53:48,436
Holly!

1907
01:53:50,946 --> 01:53:54,146
Holly!

1908
01:53:56,386 --> 01:53:59,917
Holly!

1909
01:54:01,457 --> 01:54:04,917
Holly!

1910
01:54:08,467 --> 01:54:12,297
Holly!

1911
01:54:14,167 --> 01:54:16,267
Holly!

1912
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:22,178
Come on!
We got you!

1913
01:54:22,278 --> 01:54:26,378
Oh! Oh!

1914
01:54:26,488 --> 01:54:29,418
Oh, God.
Oh, baby.

1915
01:54:29,518 --> 01:54:31,818
I thought I was never going
to see you again.

1916
01:54:31,928 --> 01:54:34,258
That's what
I thought about you.

1917
01:54:34,358 --> 01:54:37,018
I love you so much.

1918
01:54:39,698 --> 01:54:42,599
They told me there were
terrorists at the airport.

1919
01:54:42,699 --> 01:54:45,929
Yeah. I heard that, too.

1920
01:54:53,709 --> 01:54:55,339
God, that's beautiful.

1921
01:54:55,449 --> 01:54:57,349
Yeah.

1922
01:54:58,449 --> 01:55:02,249
Yup, it sure is.

1923
01:55:02,359 --> 01:55:05,290
Oh, I love you so much.

1924
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,290
Oh,John.

1925
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:12,020
Why does this
keep happening to us?

1926
01:55:17,470 --> 01:55:20,130
Let's go home.

1927
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,440
Get in the truck!

1928
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:24,370
Let's get her
out of here!

1929
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:27,041
Somebody help me,
please!

1930
01:55:27,151 --> 01:55:29,011
Oh, honey, help me
up here, please.

1931
01:55:29,121 --> 01:55:30,611
Asshole!

1932
01:55:34,221 --> 01:55:36,311
Hey, Officer!
Hey, come on!

1933
01:55:36,421 --> 01:55:37,821
Hey, hey!

1934
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:40,831
Hop on in here!
Get your missus in!
