1
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,134
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,352
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,062
In my garden.

4
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,607
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,074
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,789
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,586
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,694
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,030
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,869
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,851
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,853
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,857
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,071
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,160
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,998
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,541
You're practice.

18
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,294
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,380
- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,425
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,097
Get in.

22
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,311
Are you so
desperate to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,981
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,111
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,572
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,577
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,830
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,291
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,625
Who are you?

30
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,962
My name is merely ducard,
but I speak for ra's al ghul...

31
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,758
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,509
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,929
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,932
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,477
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,104
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,150
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,489
And what path can ra's al ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,659
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,038
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,624
The path of the league of shadows.

42
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,004
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,342
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,179
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:10,352
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,522
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,191
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,027
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,239
Which is?

50
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,700
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,662
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,249
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,877
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,712
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,841
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,927
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,847
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,517
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,296
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,907
Ra's al ghul?

61
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,711
Wait.

62
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,215
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,926
I seek...

64
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,722
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,224
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,394
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,169
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,423
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,759
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,262
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,765
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,101
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:25,231
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,445
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,865
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,118
Panther.

77
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,957
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,964
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,803
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,767
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,441
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,993
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,165
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,834
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,503
Will we be needing
an ambulance, master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,548
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an X-ray later.

87
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,966
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,137
- L'm very sorry, sir. I've told--
- don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,724
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,059
And why do we fall?

91
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,312
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,944
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,746
The bats again?

94
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,043
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,589
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,757
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,259
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,261
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,430
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,104
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,940
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,734
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,072
Did you build this train, dad?

104
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,952
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,623
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,752
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,629
And at the center...

108
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,631
...Wayne tower.

109
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,634
- Ls that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,054
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,097
- Better?
- Well...

112
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,475
...more interested men.

113
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,324
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,203
Please.

115
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,831
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,884
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,220
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,557
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,895
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,069
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,738
- That's fine.
- Fast.

122
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,406
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,575
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,869
Here you go.

125
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,416
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,420
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,921
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey--

128
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,800
Thomas!

129
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,435
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,439
It's okay.

131
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,319
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,936
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,606
It's okay.

134
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,442
Come here.

135
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,364
There you go.

136
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,494
It's okay.

137
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,164
It's okay.

138
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,670
Gordon.

139
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,346
<i>Hey-</i>

140
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,181
good news.

141
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,518
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,040
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,876
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,045
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,190
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

146
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,447
- Very well.
- Alfred?

147
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,411
- Yes, master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,246
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

149
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,458
- If I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,921
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,923
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,095
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,264
So do I, master Bruce.

154
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,935
So do I.

155
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,065
And do you still feel
responsible for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,275
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,444
Come.

158
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,785
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,038
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:26,504
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,632
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,009
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,304
Invisible?

164
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,980
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of Patience and agility.

165
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,661
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,041
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,795
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,298
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,801
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,180
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,642
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,103
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,689
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,818
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,700
Your parents' death was not your fault.

176
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,251
It was your father's.

177
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,025
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,402
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,404
I've had training.

180
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,406
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,241
Will is everything!

182
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,874
The will to act.

183
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,885
Yield.

184
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,595
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,431
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,899
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,277
Your arms will take care of themselves.

188
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,573
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,867
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,286
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,789
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,625
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,794
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:16,424
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,302
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,684
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,312
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,232
My great love.

199
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,485
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,905
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,325
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,496
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,500
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,335
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,964
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

206
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,008
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,010
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,846
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,145
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,981
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,358
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,611
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

213
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,781
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,202
-L've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

215
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,828
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,706
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne manor is your house.

217
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,708
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,044
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,297
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,551
This house, master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,387
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,142
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,978
...for what was most precious to him...

224
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,397
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,903
Miss dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,072
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,742
Should I just bury the past
out there with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,995
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,208
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,086
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,255
Never.

232
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,682
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,976
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,811
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,439
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,482
How's your mom?

237
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,152
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,155
So do I.

239
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,823
Yeah.

240
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,993
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,163
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

242
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,875
-L'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,674
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,511
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,348
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,642
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,020
- What chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,650
In prison, he shared a cell
with carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,487
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,323
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,035
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,038
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,041
Okay.

254
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,462
The depression hit working
people, like Mr. chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,840
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,842
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,888
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,724
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,019
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,314
Mr. chill?

261
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,569
Your honor...

262
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,573
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
i could take back what I did.

263
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,413
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,957
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:08,257
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,718
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,277
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,246
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,292
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,460
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,889
Come on, Bruce.

272
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,891
We don't need to see this.

273
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,143
I do.

274
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,734
The da couldn't understand
why judge faden insisted...

275
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,319
...on making the hearing public.

276
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,905
Falcone paid him off
to get chill out in the open.

277
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,323
Maybe I should thank them.

278
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,117
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

279
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,161
My parents deserved justice.

280
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,289
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

281
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:25,334
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

282
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,088
Justice is about Harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

283
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,549
-It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

284
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,476
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

285
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,353
This city is rotting.

286
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,314
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

287
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,982
Things are worse than ever here.

288
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,693
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

289
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,822
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe chills every day.

290
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,533
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

291
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,661
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

292
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,085
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

293
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,006
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

294
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,300
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

295
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,721
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

296
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,600
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

297
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,896
-L'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

298
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,193
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

299
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,571
Now I can't.

300
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,130
Your father would be ashamed of you.

301
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,134
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

302
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,470
No gun? I'm insulted.

303
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,435
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

304
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,313
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

305
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,148
Only those who know me, kid.

306
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,984
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

307
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,154
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

308
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,156
...and a judge.

309
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:05,661
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

310
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,497
Now, that's power you can't buy.

311
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,624
That's the power of fear.

312
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,292
I'm not afraid of you.

313
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,336
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

314
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,171
But you haven't thought it through.

315
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,466
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the da's office.

316
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,678
You haven't thought about
your old Butler. Bang!

317
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,517
People from your world...

318
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,019
...have so much to lose.

319
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:35,524
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

320
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,694
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

321
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,988
You've never tasted desperate.

322
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,699
You're... you're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

323
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,286
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

324
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,707
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

325
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,042
This is a world you'll never understand.

326
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,211
And you always fear...

327
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,839
...what you don't understand.

328
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,051
All right.

329
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,562
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

330
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,731
More than your old man anyway.

331
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:20,193
In the joint, chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

332
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,571
He said your father begged for mercy.

333
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,699
Begged.

334
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,242
Like a dog.

335
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,882
Should've tipped better.

336
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,727
- For what?
- Your jacket.

337
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,896
Okay.

338
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,442
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

339
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,736
Be careful who sees you with that.

340
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,238
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

341
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,407
Everyone.

342
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,453
It's...

343
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,622
It's a nice coat.

344
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:36,311
<i>Ducard". When you lived among
the criminals, did you start to pity them?</i>

345
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:40,148
<i>The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve, yes.</i>

346
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:45,821
<i>I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.</i>

347
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,157
<i>And when I traveled...</i>

348
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,077
<i>...l learned the fear before a crime...</i>

349
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,414
<i>...and the thrill of success.</i>

350
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,167
<i>Bruce".
But I never became one of them.</i>

351
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,132
Fool. What do I care
what your name is? You're a criminal.

352
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,967
I'm not a criminal

353
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,302
tell that to the guy who owned these.

354
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,516
<i>Ducard". You've traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind...</i>

355
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:15,976
...and conquer your fears.

356
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:22,190
But a criminal is not complicated.

357
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,694
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

358
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,363
You fear your own power.

359
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,865
You fear your anger...

360
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:34,536
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

361
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,206
Now you must journey inwards.

362
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,045
You are ready.

363
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,465
Breathe.

364
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,893
Breathe.

365
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,733
Breathe in your fears.

366
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,403
Face them.

367
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,699
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

368
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:16,244
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

369
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,082
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

370
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,228
You have to become a terrible thought.

371
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,942
A wraith.

372
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,075
You have to become an idea!

373
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,001
Feel terror cloud your senses.

374
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,965
Feel its power to distort.

375
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,134
To control.

376
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,016
And know that this power
can be yours.

377
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,240
Embrace your worst fear.

378
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,541
Become one with the darkness.

379
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,062
Focus.

380
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,523
Concentrate.

381
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,817
Master your senses.

382
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,348
You cannot leave any sign.

383
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,891
I haven't.

384
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,234
Impressive.

385
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,412
We have purged your fear.

386
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,207
You are ready to lead these men.

387
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,919
You are ready to become a member
of the league of shadows.

388
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,717
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

389
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,777
No.

390
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,571
I'm no executioner.

391
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,784
Your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share.

392
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,453
That's why it's so important.

393
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,455
It separates us from them.

394
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,958
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

395
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,043
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

396
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,795
Corrupt bureaucrats?

397
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,464
Criminals mock society's laws.

398
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,967
You know this better than most.

399
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,470
You cannot lead these men...

400
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,641
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

401
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,644
And where would I be leading
these men?

402
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,479
Gotham.

403
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,648
As Gotham's favored son...

404
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:18,194
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

405
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,323
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

406
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,827
Like constantinople or Rome before it...

407
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:30,165
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

408
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,002
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

409
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:39,340
This is the most important function
of the league of shadows.

410
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,719
It is one we've performed for centuries.

411
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,804
Gotham...

412
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,849
...must be destroyed.

413
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,687
You can't believe in this.

414
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:57,442
Ra's al ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

415
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:02,030
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

416
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,533
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

417
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,328
...but I will not become an executioner.

418
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,038
Bruce, please.

419
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,041
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

420
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,909
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

421
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,507
I will tell him you saved his life.

422
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,736
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

423
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,239
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

424
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,242
Apart from the mud.

425
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,161
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir'?

426
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,579
As long as it takes.

427
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,248
I want to show the people...

428
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,835
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

429
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,213
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne enterprises...

430
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,589
...combating poverty.

431
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:53,261
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

432
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,221
Did it?

433
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,765
In a way.

434
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:01,060
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

435
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,107
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

436
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,942
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

437
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,610
As a man...

438
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,238
...l'm flesh and blood,
i can be ignored, destroyed.

439
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,282
But as a symbol...

440
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,453
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

441
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,247
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

442
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,459
Something elemental...

443
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,294
...something terrifying.

444
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,588
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

445
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:33,885
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

446
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,428
You're thinking about Rachel?

447
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,972
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

448
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,726
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

449
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:46,147
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

450
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,149
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

451
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,650
You had me declared dead?

452
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,653
Actually, it was Mr. earle.
He's taking the company public.

453
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,114
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

454
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,658
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

455
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,536
Well, it's a good thing
i left everything to you, then.

456
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,663
Quite so, sir.

457
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,626
And you can borrow the rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

458
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:21,349
In my opinion, Mr. zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

459
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:26,354
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

460
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,192
- Dr. crane.
- Miss dawes.

461
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,695
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

462
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,532
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

463
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,785
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

464
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,370
...and moved into your asylum.

465
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:47,208
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

466
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,711
Or the corrupt.

467
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,590
Mr. Finch.

468
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,717
You should check
with miss dawes here...

469
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,222
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

470
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,562
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

471
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,105
Looking out for you.

472
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,527
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

473
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,737
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

474
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,575
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

475
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,076
That's sweet.

476
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,876
We've been through all that.

477
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,403
Blessed bat again, sir.

478
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,281
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

479
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,860
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

480
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,988
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

481
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,531
I'm bringing in the shipments.

482
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,408
We are paying you for that.

483
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,077
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

484
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:17,418
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

485
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,671
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here--

486
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,757
he-- he's coming to Gotham?

487
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,383
Yes, he is.

488
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,011
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

489
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:32,266
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

490
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,604
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the da's office.

491
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,898
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

492
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,942
Idealist, huh?

493
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,819
Well, there's an answer to that too.

494
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,114
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

495
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:54,789
No, we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors.

496
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,125
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

497
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,461
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

498
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:05,633
Well, that's 20 years ago, fredericks.

499
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,136
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

500
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,139
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

501
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,141
Good morning, Mr. earle's office.

502
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,645
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

503
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:21,148
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. earle.

504
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,817
Name?

505
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,944
Bruce Wayne.

506
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:30,324
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

507
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:34,578
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

508
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,831
Jessica?

509
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,459
Jessica? Where are you?

510
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,880
- Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

511
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,676
It's Wayne enterprises, Mr. earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

512
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,512
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

513
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,681
I'm sorry to disappoint.

514
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,517
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

515
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,394
- Who?
- Wayne.

516
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,813
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

517
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,653
I'm sure you realize
i can't stop the big machine.

518
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,029
Too many wheels turning.

519
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,198
- We're going public.
- I understand.

520
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,535
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

521
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,204
I'm not looking to interfere.

522
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,832
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

523
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,043
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

524
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,129
Any ideas where you would start?

525
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,007
Applied sciences caught my eye.

526
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,050
Fox's department.

527
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,219
I'll let him know you're coming.

528
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,931
You look like him. Your dad.

529
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,393
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

530
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,522
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

531
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:48,360
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

532
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,572
All prototypes. None in production.

533
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,408
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

534
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,244
What did they tell you this place was?

535
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,455
They didn't tell me anything.

536
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,377
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

537
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,254
Dead end.

538
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:10,758
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

539
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,260
Come on.

540
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,888
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

541
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,932
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

542
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,767
Helped him build his train.

543
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,977
Here we are.

544
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,274
Kevlar utility harness.

545
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,610
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

546
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,112
The 350-pound test monofilament.

547
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,618
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

548
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:42,748
Routed it right into Wayne tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

549
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:46,126
Kind of made Wayne tower
the unofficial center of Gotham city.

550
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,963
Of course, earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

551
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,967
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

552
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,928
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

553
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,639
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

554
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,975
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

555
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,061
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

556
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,605
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

557
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:11,151
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

558
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,320
I want to borrow it.

559
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,281
For spelunking.

560
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,449
Spelunking?

561
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,326
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

562
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,289
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

563
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,836
Look, I'd rather Mr. earle
didn't know about me borrowing--

564
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,296
Mr. Wayne...

565
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,423
...the way I see it...

566
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,342
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

567
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,806
Okay. Give it a try.

568
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,186
Charming.

569
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,816
At least you'll have company.

570
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:56,697
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

571
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:13,339
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the underground railroad...

572
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,508
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the north...

573
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,387
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

574
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,235
Alfred! Come up here!

575
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,405
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

576
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,095
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

577
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,763
Via a dummy corporation.

578
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,765
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

579
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:09,895
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

580
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,399
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

581
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:17,611
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

582
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:20,280
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

583
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,744
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

584
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,930
Don't suppose you want a taste.

585
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,267
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

586
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,602
There's nothing wise
in what you do, flass.

587
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,148
Well, jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

588
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,150
I'm no rat.

589
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,614
In a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

590
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,324
Raughs]

591
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,438
Don't turn around.

592
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,108
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

593
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:39,860
What do you want?

594
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,197
Carmine Falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week.

595
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,199
Nobody takes him down. Why?

596
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,744
He's paid up with the right people.

597
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,830
What will it take to bring him down?

598
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,958
Leverage on judge faden...

599
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,045
...and a da brave enough
to prosecute.

600
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,047
Rachel dawes.

601
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,757
Who are you?

602
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,842
Watch for my sign.

603
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,555
You're just one man?

604
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,390
Now we're two.

605
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,061
We?

606
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,495
Freeze!

607
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,597
What the hell was that?

608
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,726
Just some nut.

609
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,941
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

610
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,610
No. Today it's base-jumping.

611
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,821
Base-jumping.

612
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,949
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

613
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,953
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

614
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,789
You know, I think I have just the thing.

615
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,585
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

616
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,798
Regularly flexible...

617
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,342
...but put a current through it...

618
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:32,472
-...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

619
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,809
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

620
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,144
Too expensive for the army?

621
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:42,107
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, base-jumping crowd.

622
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:44,067
- Look, Mr. fox.
- Yes, sir?

623
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,111
If you're uncomfortable--

624
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:49,489
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

625
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,617
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

626
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,954
But don't think of me as an idiot.

627
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,416
Fair enough.

628
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,170
What's that?

629
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,174
The tumbler?

630
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,635
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

631
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,517
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

632
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,982
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

633
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:30,155
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

634
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,908
This will boost you into a rampless jump--
not now!

635
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,871
Not-- not now, sir.

636
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,542
<i>Afterburner disengaged.</i>

637
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,004
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

638
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,881
...but this baby works just fine.

639
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,684
So, what do you think?

640
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,937
Does it come in black?

641
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,940
I need you at the docks Thursday.

642
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,067
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

643
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,361
-...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

644
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,574
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the da's office.

645
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,202
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

646
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,080
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

647
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,207
So, what's your point, Mr. flass?

648
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,917
Have you seen the girl?

649
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,087
<i>It's a <i>cute little assistant da.</i></i>

650
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:30,924
<i>Don't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?</i>

651
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,428
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham city.

652
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,431
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

653
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,225
Sometimes--
sometimes things just go bad.

654
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,897
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

655
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,775
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

656
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,528
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

657
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:57,284
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

658
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,323
Why bats, master Wayne?

659
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:37,824
Bats frighten me.

660
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,453
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

661
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,065
What is this?

662
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,195
Continue.

663
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,369
Looks fine out there.

664
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,704
The bears go straight to the dealers.

665
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,541
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the narrows.

666
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,710
- What's the difference?
-Lgnorance is bliss, my friend.

667
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,047
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

668
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,899
Hey. Steiss.

669
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,672
Steiss?

670
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,227
What?

671
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,438
What the...?

672
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,282
I better check it.

673
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,796
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

674
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,494
Where are you?!

675
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,662
Here.

676
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,353
Take a ride. Oh, shit.

677
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,290
What the hell are you?

678
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,877
I'm Batman.

679
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,179
Nice coat.

680
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,391
Thanks.

681
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,725
Hold it.

682
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,313
That's right, you better run.

683
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,115
Falcone sent them to kill you.

684
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,827
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

685
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,124
- What's this?
- Leverage.

686
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,959
- For what?
- To get things moving.

687
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,253
Who are you?

688
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,880
Someone like you.

689
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,091
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

690
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,641
Ma'am? Everything okay?

691
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,481
- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

692
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,942
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

693
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,277
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

694
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,167
What the hell is that?

695
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,011
Cut him down.

696
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,869
Unacceptable.

697
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,872
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
guardian angels...

698
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,999
...or the goddamn salvation army...

699
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,543
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

700
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,337
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

701
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,215
It was some asshole in a costume.

702
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,384
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

703
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,345
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

704
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:18,016
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

705
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,392
Understand?

706
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,395
- No way to bury it now.
- There's still judge faden.

707
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:25,523
-L've got faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

708
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,693
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

709
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,029
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

710
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:34,407
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

711
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,367
Okay. Let's do it.

712
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,915
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

713
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:45,502
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

714
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,422
The price for leading a double life,
i fear.

715
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:53,176
Your theatrics made an impression.

716
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,597
Theatricality and deception...

717
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:00,934
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

718
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,937
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

719
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,940
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

720
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,608
Polo, for instance.

721
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,443
I'm not learning Polo, Alfred.

722
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,364
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

723
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,949
These things beg the question...

724
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:20,411
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

725
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,121
What does someone like me do?

726
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:27,293
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

727
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,587
Buy things that are not for sale.

728
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:33,299
Who knows, master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

729
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,927
...you might even have a little
by accident.

730
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,098
Sir.

731
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:42,600
- We have a situation.
- All right.

732
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:46,813
The coast guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

733
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:52,151
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

734
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,573
<i>The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.</i>

735
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,575
<i>It's a microwave emitter.</i>

736
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,661
It's designed for desert warfare, but it--

737
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,956
it looks like somebody...

738
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,837
...turned it on.

739
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:19,470
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

740
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,356
<i>The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.</i>

741
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,526
The weapon itself is...

742
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,321
Missing?

743
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,364
Yeah.

744
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,659
Mr. Wayne.

745
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,831
Nice car.

746
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,374
You should see my other one.

747
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:00,345
He's done something
the police never have.

748
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,805
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

749
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,558
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

750
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,061
- Bruce, help me out here.
- Huh?

751
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:12,565
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

752
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,818
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

753
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,363
Now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

754
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,739
They're jealous.

755
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:22,575
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

756
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:26,120
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

757
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,916
Well, they're European.

758
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,128
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

759
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:38,508
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

760
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,885
...l'm buying this hotel...

761
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:47,100
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

762
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,603
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

763
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,939
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

764
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,030
Thank you.

765
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,117
Bruce?

766
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,455
Rachel?

767
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,082
I'd heard you were back.

768
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,627
What are you doing?

769
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:19,799
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

770
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:21,467
You were gone a long time.

771
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,971
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

772
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,599
Job's getting worse.

773
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,477
Can't change the world on your own.

774
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,730
What choice do I have...

775
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,149
...when you're too busy swimming?

776
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,485
Rachel, all of--

777
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,487
all this...

778
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:46,951
Lt's-- it's not me. Lt's...

779
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,996
Inside, I am...

780
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,166
I am more.

781
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,334
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

782
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,338
Bruce, we have
some more hotels for you to buy.

783
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,841
Bruce...

784
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:06,512
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

785
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,517
But it's not who you are underneath...

786
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,728
...it's what you do that defines you.

787
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,867
Dr. crane, thanks for coming.

788
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,870
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

789
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:34,707
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

790
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,877
Of course, better safe than sorry.

791
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,884
Yeah, Dr. crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

792
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:47,512
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

793
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,556
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

794
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,226
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

795
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,895
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

796
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,231
About what?
You don't know anything.

797
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:02,568
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

798
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:06,906
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

799
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,743
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

800
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,247
And those goons you used.

801
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,249
I own the muscle in this town.

802
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:19,794
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

803
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:24,549
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

804
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,928
Well, I already know what he'll say.

805
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:30,763
That we should kill you.

806
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,935
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

807
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,442
Would you like to see my mask?

808
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,445
I use it in my experiments.

809
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:53,411
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

810
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,622
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

811
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:59,458
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

812
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:03,546
They scream and they cry...

813
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,756
...much as you're doing now.

814
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,304
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

815
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,973
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

816
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,602
...to the secure wing at arkham.
I can't treat him here.

817
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,125
Storm's coming.

818
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,674
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

819
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:52,428
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

820
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:55,306
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

821
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,477
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

822
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,520
Why? What about the other half?

823
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,440
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

824
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,651
He'll talk to me.

825
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,862
Commissioner loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

826
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,865
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

827
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,036
I think you're trying to help.

828
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,377
But I've been wrong before.

829
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,884
Come on, I ain't got all night.

830
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:37,056
Flass, I have kids to feed.

831
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,684
What, they don't like falafel?

832
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,742
Where were the other drugs going?

833
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:00,246
I never knew. I don't know.

834
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,581
- I swear to god.
- Swear to me!

835
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:11,257
I don't-- I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

836
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,969
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

837
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,470
Why?

838
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,725
There was something--
something else in the drugs...

839
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:22,435
-...something hidden.
- What?

840
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,938
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the narrows.

841
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:29,442
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

842
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,402
No--!

843
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,043
This is the one I'm talking about.

844
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,628
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

845
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:53,632
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

846
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,218
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

847
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,764
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

848
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:03,267
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

849
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:13,819
What the hell is this?

850
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,865
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

851
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,201
Get in here!

852
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,954
The other kids won't believe me.

853
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,187
Get rid of all traces.

854
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,399
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

855
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:11,228
Having trouble?

856
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,273
Take a seat. Have a drink.

857
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,235
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

858
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,950
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

859
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:20,631
Alfred, help me.

860
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:33,852
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

861
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:37,022
Poisonous. Poisonous.

862
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,028
<i>Bruce...</i>

863
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:45,531
<i>...why do we fall?</i>

864
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,879
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

865
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:03,132
It's your birthday.

866
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:05,718
Many happy returns.

867
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:14,727
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

868
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:19,481
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

869
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,568
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

870
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:25,863
I called Mr. fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

871
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,406
I analyzed your blood...

872
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:31,076
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

873
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,037
Am I meant to understand any of that?

874
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:36,582
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

875
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:40,878
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

876
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,589
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

877
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:47,009
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

878
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,928
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

879
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,557
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

880
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,101
Alfred, always a pleasure.

881
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,936
Lucius.

882
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:05,110
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

883
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,945
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

884
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,530
Rachel?

885
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:13,118
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

886
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,954
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

887
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:19,792
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

888
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:23,379
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

889
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,881
...which means I should
probably start by looking...

890
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,800
-...at the bottom of the river.
- Rachel.

891
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:30,344
Excuse me.

892
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,138
Rachel dawes.

893
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:37,309
Who authorized that? Get crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

894
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:41,397
Call Dr. lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

895
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,649
- What's wrong?
-Lt's Falcone.

896
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,318
Dr. crane moved him to arkham asylum
on suicide watch.

897
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:49,488
You're going to arkham now?
It's in the narrows, Rachel.

898
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,574
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

899
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,494
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

900
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,831
Happy birthday.

901
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,352
But, master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

902
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,146
Keep them happy until I arrive.

903
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,523
Tell them that joke you know.

904
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,063
Having fun?

905
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:10,736
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

906
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,237
I need some information.

907
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:17,201
The Wayne enterprise 47-b, 1-me.

908
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:19,995
1-me.

909
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:23,916
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

910
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:28,253
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

911
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:30,422
...but isn't that illegal?

912
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:36,386
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

913
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:40,557
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

914
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,601
Did you lose one?

915
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:47,272
I'm merging your department
with archives.

916
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:49,775
And I am firing you.

917
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:53,904
Didn't you get the memo?

918
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,788
Scarecrow.

919
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,960
Scarecrow.

920
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:12,631
Scarecrow.

921
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,803
Miss dawes, this is most irregular.

922
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,931
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

923
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,308
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

924
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:27,813
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

925
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:31,608
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

926
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:36,029
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

927
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,077
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

928
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:46,164
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

929
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,458
...on an external tormentor...

930
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:51,837
...usually one conforming
to jungian archetypes.

931
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:54,464
In this case, a scarecrow.

932
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:00,012
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

933
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:02,139
I'm a strong advocate.

934
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,683
<i>Outside, he was a giant.</i>

935
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,352
In here, only the mind
can Grant you power.

936
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,271
You enjoy the reversal.

937
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:12,441
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

938
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,151
It's why I do what I do.

939
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:19,197
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

940
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,701
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

941
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:26,204
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

942
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,874
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

943
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:32,502
I've already paged Dr. lehmann
at county general.

944
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:35,714
As you wish.

945
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,180
This way, please.

946
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,974
There's something
i think you should see.

947
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,488
This is where we make the medicine.

948
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:10,207
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

949
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,067
Who knows you're here?

950
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,736
Who knows?

951
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:48,203
He's here.

952
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,621
Who?

953
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,748
The Batman.

954
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,460
- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

955
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:58,422
...when a prowler comes around.

956
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:01,925
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

957
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:05,262
At this point, they can't stop us.

958
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:08,974
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

959
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:12,227
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

960
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,646
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

961
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,773
I gave her a concentrated dose.

962
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,484
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

963
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,322
The things they say about him.

964
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,991
Can he really fly?

965
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,285
I heard he can disappear.

966
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:31,496
Well, we'll find out.

967
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,415
Won't we?

968
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,881
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

969
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:31,389
What have you been doing here?

970
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:36,895
Who are you working for?

971
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,693
Ra's-- ra's al ghul.

972
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:48,740
Ra's al ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

973
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:49,908
Crane.

974
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,372
Dr. crane isn't here right now.

975
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:57,833
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

976
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:13,765
Batman,
put down your weapons and surrender.

977
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:15,892
You're surrounded.

978
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,234
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

979
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:27,362
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

980
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:29,698
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

981
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,408
...l'll be right behind you, sir.

982
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,452
SWAT's on the way.

983
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:36,830
- Hey.
- Hey.

984
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:20,999
What's happened to her?

985
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:27,505
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

986
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:33,261
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

987
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,351
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

988
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:50,195
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

989
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:52,530
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

990
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,699
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

991
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:56,201
Was he working for Falcone?

992
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,204
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

993
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:01,998
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

994
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,376
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

995
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,048
What is that?

996
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,718
- Backup.
- What the--?

997
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:33,465
Excuse me.

998
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:41,473
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

999
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:44,768
I'll get my car.

1000
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:46,770
I brought mine.

1001
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,813
Yours?

1002
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,949
I've gotta get me one of those.

1003
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:01,785
He is in a vehicle.

1004
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:03,453
<i>Make and color?</i>

1005
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,830
It's a black...

1006
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:08,500
...tank.

1007
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,504
Stay calm.

1008
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:14,964
You've been poisoned.

1009
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:19,010
I'm on him.

1010
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:28,478
Breathe slowly.

1011
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:39,697
Hold on.

1012
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,547
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1013
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,349
Air one to ground, <i>block</i> that <i>ramp.</i>

1014
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,021
<i>He's got no way off that roof.</i>

1015
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:16,526
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1016
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:21,656
<i>- Trust me.
- Weapons system activated.</i>

1017
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:40,592
Who is this guy?

1018
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,260
<i>Where's he going?</i>

1019
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:43,636
He's on the roof.

1020
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,944
- What street is he taking?
- He's not on a <i>street.</i>

1021
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:01,404
He's flying on rooftops.

1022
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,820
At least tell me what it looks like.

1023
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,325
Never mind.

1024
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:52,580
Got him.

1025
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:05,009
Corning right up on his butt.

1026
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:32,954
<i>We're tracking suspect
vehicle heading Weston i-17.</i>

1027
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,168
<i>- Air one to ground.</i>
- I <i>lost him.</i>

1028
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:41,379
<i>We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.</i>

1029
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:43,506
<i>We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.</i>

1030
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:45,675
<i>Stealth mode activated.</i>

1031
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:47,552
Stay with me.

1032
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,226
What--? There he is.

1033
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,372
Just hold on.

1034
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:21,544
Rachel!

1035
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:55,787
They get any of this into the mains'?

1036
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:56,954
Yeah.

1037
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:59,957
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1038
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,794
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1039
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,464
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1040
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:08,966
Must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1041
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,895
How do you feel?

1042
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,149
Where are we?

1043
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:29,445
- Why did you bring me here?
- If I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1044
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:31,656
- You were poisoned.
- It was--

1045
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:35,451
- it was Dr. crane.
- Rest. Gordon has crane.

1046
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:37,745
Is sergeant Gordon your friend?

1047
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,248
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1048
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:44,460
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1049
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:48,589
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1050
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,508
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1051
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:54,011
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1052
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:55,680
Mass production?

1053
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:59,016
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1054
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,379
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1055
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:31,466
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1056
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:34,135
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1057
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:37,346
-It's not.
- What would you call that?

1058
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:41,893
- Damn good television.
-Lt's a miracle no one was killed.

1059
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:45,730
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1060
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:49,025
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1061
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:53,571
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1062
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:55,364
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1063
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:58,451
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1064
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:02,246
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1065
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:05,333
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1066
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:09,253
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1067
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,423
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1068
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,509
- Is fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1069
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,302
We need to send these people away.

1070
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:19,430
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1071
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:21,432
I don't care about my name.

1072
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:24,769
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1073
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:28,940
And it's all that's left of him.

1074
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:32,443
Don't destroy it.

1075
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,919
- Mr. earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1076
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,504
Thank you.

1077
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:53,798
How did the stock offering go?

1078
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,299
Prices soared.

1079
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:56,717
Who was buying?

1080
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,803
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1081
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,638
It's a bit technical.

1082
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:02,557
The key thing is...

1083
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,725
...our company's future is secure.

1084
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:07,603
Great.

1085
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:23,619
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1086
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:31,127
What was the plan, crane?

1087
01:41:31,294 --> 01:41:33,546
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1088
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:37,174
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1089
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:39,176
Who were you working for, crane?

1090
01:41:41,304 --> 01:41:43,514
Oh, it's too late.

1091
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:46,183
You can't stop it now.

1092
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,815
Here.

1093
01:41:52,982 --> 01:41:55,026
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1094
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:58,070
And thank you for that item.

1095
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:00,823
You're welcome.

1096
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:03,784
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1097
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:07,872
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1098
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:09,540
Weeks. Why?

1099
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:12,877
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1100
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,964
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1101
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:19,300
What?

1102
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:22,011
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1103
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:25,056
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1104
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:28,726
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne enterprises just misplaced.

1105
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:30,394
Misplaced?

1106
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:34,065
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1107
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:39,570
Go back to Wayne enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1108
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:42,865
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1109
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:45,076
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1110
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:47,244
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1111
01:42:47,703 --> 01:42:49,413
I suppose not.

1112
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:56,087
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1113
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:59,173
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1114
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,759
...Mr. ra's al ghul?

1115
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:09,225
You're not ra's al ghul.

1116
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:12,061
I watched him die.

1117
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:15,272
But is ra's al ghul immortal?

1118
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:20,444
Are his methods supernatural?

1119
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:29,453
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, ra's?

1120
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:35,793
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1121
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,962
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1122
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:40,631
I saved your life.

1123
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:43,300
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1124
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,681
Your quarrel is with me.

1125
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:52,059
You let these people go.

1126
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:55,604
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1127
01:43:57,815 --> 01:43:59,483
Everyone.

1128
01:44:00,276 --> 01:44:02,153
Everybody?

1129
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,615
"I"

1130
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:11,328
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1131
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:15,124
No, really.

1132
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:18,919
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1133
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:22,673
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1134
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:26,510
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1135
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:29,305
- That's enough, Bruce.
-L'm not finished.

1136
01:44:29,638 --> 01:44:31,348
To all of you...

1137
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:35,853
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1138
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:41,150
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1139
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:44,862
...please, leave me in peace.

1140
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:47,698
Please go.

1141
01:44:48,032 --> 01:44:51,452
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1142
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:53,829
The party's over, get out.

1143
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:57,249
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1144
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,381
He's turning into a jerk.

1145
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:12,389
Amusing.

1146
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:16,185
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1147
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:19,855
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1148
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,191
So crane was working for you.

1149
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:26,195
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1150
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:28,572
He was able to weaponize it.

1151
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:30,741
He's not a member of
the league of shadows?

1152
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:35,412
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1153
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:40,709
But really, you are gonna release
crane's poison on the entire city.

1154
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:44,922
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1155
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,687
<i>You're gonna destroy millions of lives.</i>

1156
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:03,357
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1157
01:46:03,524 --> 01:46:05,234
Crime. Despair.

1158
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:07,444
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1159
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:11,282
The league of shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1160
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:12,950
...for thousands of years.

1161
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:16,704
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1162
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:18,289
Burned London to the ground.

1163
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:21,292
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1164
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,419
...we return to restore the balance.

1165
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:25,129
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1166
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:29,133
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1167
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:31,135
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1168
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:34,471
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1169
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:46,984
Time to play.

1170
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:53,824
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1171
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:56,118
But I believed in you.

1172
01:46:56,285 --> 01:46:59,997
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1173
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:02,499
You were my greatest student.

1174
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:06,003
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1175
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:09,423
I'll be standing where I belong.

1176
01:47:10,007 --> 01:47:13,177
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1177
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:17,473
No one can save Gotham.

1178
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:25,481
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1179
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:31,362
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1180
01:47:31,904 --> 01:47:35,157
The movement back to Harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1181
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,660
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1182
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:40,537
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1183
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:43,540
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1184
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:48,712
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1185
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,340
...such as your parents.

1186
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:58,889
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1187
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:01,892
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1188
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:04,561
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1189
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:07,398
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1190
01:48:07,564 --> 01:48:09,400
We are back to finish the job.

1191
01:48:10,067 --> 01:48:13,362
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1192
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:17,074
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1193
01:48:17,408 --> 01:48:20,244
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1194
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:24,540
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1195
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:31,714
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1196
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,924
...to mind your surroundings.

1197
01:48:36,093 --> 01:48:38,095
Justice is balance.

1198
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:40,431
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1199
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,269
Consider us even.

1200
01:49:01,618 --> 01:49:03,412
No one comes out. Make sure.

1201
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:14,757
They're all gone?

1202
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:17,634
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1203
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:19,636
Serial killers, rapists.

1204
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:22,639
Raise the Bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1205
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:24,475
Yeah, I'll raise the Bridges...

1206
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:28,729
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1207
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:31,774
-...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1208
01:49:54,963 --> 01:49:57,674
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1209
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,849
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1210
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:14,691
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1211
01:50:53,188 --> 01:50:55,232
What have I done, Alfred?

1212
01:50:56,233 --> 01:50:58,235
Everything my family...

1213
01:50:58,402 --> 01:51:00,320
...my father, built...

1214
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:06,577
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1215
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:09,037
I wanted to save Gotham.

1216
01:51:09,872 --> 01:51:11,748
I failed.

1217
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,251
Why do we fall, sir?

1218
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:20,924
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1219
01:51:23,385 --> 01:51:25,554
You still haven't given up on me?

1220
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:28,932
Never.

1221
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:31,268
Down!

1222
01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:34,396
Harassment! I see harassment!

1223
01:51:34,563 --> 01:51:36,607
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1224
01:51:36,773 --> 01:51:38,734
Madman with a gun.

1225
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,445
<i>With residents furious...</i>

1226
01:51:41,653 --> 01:51:44,781
<i>...at the unprecedented show of police
strength to round up the inmates...</i>

1227
01:51:44,948 --> 01:51:46,783
We're about to raise these Bridges.

1228
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:50,621
Officer, I am a Gotham city
district attorney. Let me pass.

1229
01:51:57,961 --> 01:52:00,297
- Just shut up!
- Hey, flass, cool it!

1230
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:01,965
Hold these people back.

1231
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:04,927
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1232
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:07,471
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

1233
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:09,139
It counteracts crane's toxin.

1234
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:10,807
Hopefully you won't need it.

1235
01:52:10,974 --> 01:52:14,144
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1236
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:17,731
All right, last one across.

1237
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:22,319
People, they want this
bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1238
01:52:22,486 --> 01:52:25,906
Better get you off the island before
they raise the Bridges. Patrolman!

1239
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:27,532
Go!

1240
01:52:54,351 --> 01:52:56,186
I can't find my mom.

1241
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,021
Hey!

1242
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,156
What the hell are you doing?

1243
01:53:09,658 --> 01:53:11,243
Gentlemen...

1244
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:14,204
...time to spread the word.

1245
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:17,332
And the word is...

1246
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:20,335
...panic.

1247
01:53:44,318 --> 01:53:45,861
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1248
01:53:47,237 --> 01:53:48,363
Right there.

1249
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:50,907
That water main
is right under the narrows.

1250
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,426
It's okay.

1251
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,794
This is commissioner loeb.

1252
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:45,629
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1253
01:54:45,837 --> 01:54:47,297
Come on!

1254
01:55:06,983 --> 01:55:08,985
Loeb, loeb. This is Gordon.

1255
01:55:09,319 --> 01:55:10,654
What the hell is going on?

1256
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:14,282
We need reinforcements.
Tac teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1257
01:55:14,449 --> 01:55:18,662
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1258
01:55:18,829 --> 01:55:21,498
<i>Well, they're completely incapacitated!</i>

1259
01:55:21,665 --> 01:55:25,168
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1260
01:55:26,002 --> 01:55:27,671
Of course they are!

1261
01:55:27,838 --> 01:55:30,841
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1262
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:34,010
Gordon...

1263
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:36,430
...there's nobody left to send in.

1264
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:39,641
So I'm on my own?

1265
01:55:43,728 --> 01:55:45,397
The narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1266
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:48,150
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1267
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:51,069
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1268
01:55:51,236 --> 01:55:53,155
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

1269
01:55:53,321 --> 01:55:57,159
<i>The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne tower.</i>

1270
01:55:57,325 --> 01:55:59,035
<i>If the machine gets to the station...</i>

1271
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:02,706
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1272
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:04,458
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1273
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:07,836
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1274
01:56:08,003 --> 01:56:09,796
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1275
01:56:16,052 --> 01:56:17,721
There you are!

1276
01:56:17,888 --> 01:56:19,890
There is nothing to fear...

1277
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:21,808
...but fear itself!

1278
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:24,603
I am here to help you!

1279
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,595
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1280
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:05,727
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1281
01:57:14,361 --> 01:57:17,739
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1282
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:25,747
I told you he'd come.

1283
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:32,379
Wait.

1284
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:34,965
You could die.

1285
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:36,424
At least tell me your name.

1286
01:57:41,805 --> 01:57:44,015
It's not who I am underneath...

1287
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:49,396
...but what I do that defines me.

1288
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:50,981
Bruce?

1289
01:58:24,681 --> 01:58:28,018
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1290
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:30,687
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1291
01:58:30,854 --> 01:58:33,189
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1292
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:36,693
Now, if you'll excuse me,
i have a city to destroy.

1293
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:40,572
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1294
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:55,712
<i>GPS online.</i>

1295
01:59:02,552 --> 01:59:04,721
<i>In 100 yards.</i>

1296
01:59:35,627 --> 01:59:36,920
Gentlemen.

1297
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:06,574
Who the hell authorized this?

1298
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:19,212
<i>Distance to Wayne tower, three miles.</i>

1299
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:29,097
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1300
02:00:29,264 --> 02:00:30,640
If that pressure reaches us...

1301
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:33,810
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1302
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:47,157
<i>At the next intersection, turn right.</i>

1303
02:01:11,848 --> 02:01:13,308
You will never learn.

1304
02:01:20,857 --> 02:01:21,858
Sorry.

1305
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:28,865
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1306
02:01:45,632 --> 02:01:47,884
<i>You have arrived at Wayne tower.</i>

1307
02:02:01,231 --> 02:02:02,482
Evacuate the building.

1308
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:05,193
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1309
02:02:14,077 --> 02:02:16,287
<i>Weapons system activated.</i>

1310
02:02:20,375 --> 02:02:21,417
Nice ride.

1311
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:37,684
Armed.

1312
02:02:49,612 --> 02:02:51,072
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1313
02:02:53,867 --> 02:02:55,243
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:02:59,956 --> 02:03:02,083
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1315
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:06,129
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1316
02:03:06,296 --> 02:03:08,882
Who said anything about stopping it?

1317
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:16,222
Yes!

1318
02:03:24,397 --> 02:03:27,817
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1319
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:38,161
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1320
02:03:38,453 --> 02:03:40,747
I won't kill you...

1321
02:03:45,168 --> 02:03:47,337
...but I don't have to save you.

1322
02:05:02,495 --> 02:05:05,581
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1323
02:05:09,836 --> 02:05:12,755
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1324
02:05:13,256 --> 02:05:14,841
You did.

1325
02:05:15,008 --> 02:05:17,093
I got another job.

1326
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:19,387
Yours.

1327
02:05:19,846 --> 02:05:21,556
On whose authority?

1328
02:05:22,056 --> 02:05:24,100
Batman may
have made the front page...

1329
02:05:24,267 --> 02:05:27,228
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1330
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,069
Bruce Wayne.

1331
02:05:35,236 --> 02:05:39,032
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne enterprises?

1332
02:05:39,198 --> 02:05:42,076
<i>- The fact that I'm the owner.
- What are you talking about?</i>

1333
02:05:42,243 --> 02:05:44,120
The company went public a week ago.

1334
02:05:44,287 --> 02:05:45,747
And I bought most of the shares.

1335
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:49,584
<i>Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.</i>

1336
02:05:49,751 --> 02:05:52,962
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1337
02:05:53,129 --> 02:05:56,466
...is <i>that my company's future
is secure.</i>

1338
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:58,259
Right, Mr. fox?

1339
02:05:58,426 --> 02:06:00,261
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1340
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:04,057
Didn't you get the memo?

1341
02:06:22,992 --> 02:06:26,162
-L'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1342
02:06:26,329 --> 02:06:27,747
...l'm sorry.

1343
02:06:28,623 --> 02:06:31,292
The day that chill died, l...

1344
02:06:33,169 --> 02:06:34,796
I said terrible things.

1345
02:06:35,296 --> 02:06:37,048
But true things.

1346
02:06:37,673 --> 02:06:39,509
I was a coward with a gun...

1347
02:06:39,675 --> 02:06:43,471
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1348
02:06:44,514 --> 02:06:47,183
I never stopped thinking about you.

1349
02:06:48,684 --> 02:06:50,311
About us.

1350
02:06:50,937 --> 02:06:52,855
And when I heard you were back, l...

1351
02:06:53,689 --> 02:06:55,942
I started to hope.

1352
02:07:20,007 --> 02:07:22,718
But then I found out about your mask.

1353
02:07:23,886 --> 02:07:26,722
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1354
02:07:27,348 --> 02:07:29,016
No. This...

1355
02:07:30,184 --> 02:07:31,894
...is your mask.

1356
02:07:33,855 --> 02:07:37,400
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1357
02:07:38,234 --> 02:07:40,236
The man I loved...

1358
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:42,405
...the man who vanished...

1359
02:07:43,614 --> 02:07:45,741
...he never came back at all.

1360
02:07:50,246 --> 02:07:52,915
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1361
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:58,754
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1362
02:07:59,839 --> 02:08:01,757
...l'll see him again.

1363
02:08:12,852 --> 02:08:15,771
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1364
02:08:18,608 --> 02:08:21,068
Your father would be very proud of you.

1365
02:08:21,277 --> 02:08:22,904
Just like me.

1366
02:08:49,889 --> 02:08:51,766
What will you do?

1367
02:08:53,142 --> 02:08:54,727
Rebuild it.

1368
02:08:55,603 --> 02:08:57,980
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1369
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,072
Just the way it was, sir?

1370
02:09:08,157 --> 02:09:09,408
Yeah, why?

1371
02:09:09,575 --> 02:09:12,411
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1372
02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:14,997
...improving the foundations.

1373
02:09:15,206 --> 02:09:18,167
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1374
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:36,727
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1375
02:09:37,687 --> 02:09:40,356
Well, sergeant?
- Lt's "lieutenant" now.

1376
02:09:40,731 --> 02:09:42,191
You really started something.

1377
02:09:42,358 --> 02:09:44,360
Bent cops running scared.

1378
02:09:44,527 --> 02:09:45,987
Hope on the streets.

1379
02:09:46,237 --> 02:09:49,865
- But?
- The narrows is lost.

1380
02:09:50,366 --> 02:09:54,203
And we still haven't picked up crane or
half the inmates of arkham that he freed.

1381
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:56,539
We will.

1382
02:09:56,747 --> 02:09:58,374
We can bring Gotham back.

1383
02:09:58,541 --> 02:10:01,043
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1384
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:05,548
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1385
02:10:05,756 --> 02:10:10,052
We start wearing kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1386
02:10:10,261 --> 02:10:13,556
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1387
02:10:13,973 --> 02:10:15,850
...and jumping off rooftops.

1388
02:10:17,268 --> 02:10:19,312
Now, take this guy.

1389
02:10:19,562 --> 02:10:21,564
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1390
02:10:21,772 --> 02:10:25,026
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1391
02:10:25,276 --> 02:10:27,236
Leaves a calling card.

1392
02:10:33,075 --> 02:10:34,910
I'll look into it.

1393
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:39,874
I never said thank you.

1394
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:47,048
And you'll never have to.
