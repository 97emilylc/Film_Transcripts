1
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,894
Broke in right
on the two of them.

2
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,189
No matter what they say,
it's all about money.

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,609
So let's imagine, ladies, that you're
a Savings and Loan officer. Watch.

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,570
One, two, three. See?

5
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,781
You've got it all,
and we've got nothin'.

6
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,824
- And you have all four. Take a look.
- Oh!

7
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,826
But I wouldn't trust you
with real gold.

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,454
- That's why this one's only worth about a penny.
- Hmm.

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,165
And if you wonder where
the other one went, watch.

10
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,543
A penny from the ear.
How much for the rest?

11
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,045
- Have you seen Edward?
- No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,631
My wife went to a lot of trouble;
she called a caterer.

13
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,842
- Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you?
- Philip, good.

14
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,927
Hey, I understand Edward's
taking over Morse Industries.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,179
- Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan.
- Can I get in on it?

16
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,181
- Yeah. Call me.
- When?

17
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,183
Just call me.

18
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,103
- Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer.
- Where's the guest of honor?

19
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,814
He's probably off in a corner
somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,691
How are you?

21
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,319
I told my secretary to make the
arrangements. Didn't she call you?

22
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,323
Yes, she did. I speak to
your secretary more than I speak to you.

23
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,201
- I see.
- I have my own life too, you know, Edward.

24
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,204
This is a very important week
for me. I need you here.

25
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:23,542
But you never give me any notice. You
just think I'm at your beck and call.

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,670
I do not believe that you
are at my beck and call.

27
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,714
Well, that's the way
you always make me feel.

28
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,466
- Maybe I should just move out.
- If that's what you want, yes.

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,510
All right, when you get back
to New York, we'll discuss it.

30
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,096
- Now is as good a time as any.
- That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,098
Good-bye, Jessica.

32
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,648
- Phil suggested that maybe I should
take a I- - Phil is just my lawyer, okay?

33
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,610
- Yes, sir.
- How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei?

34
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:53,071
- I don't know.
- You don't know? Tokyo opened maybe 90 minutes ago.

35
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,073
- You have to keep on top of these things, all right?
- Done.

36
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,117
- Hello, Mr. Lewis.
- Hi. How you doin'? I want this whole thing...

37
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,578
wrapped up as soon as possible;
I gotta get to New York by Sunday.

38
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,538
- I got tickets to the Met.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,917
- Your coat, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,586
- Edward!
- Susan!

41
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,588
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,508
- I was sorry to hear about Carter.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

43
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:16,929
- Heard you got married.
- Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you!

44
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,681
Mmm. Susan, tell me something.

45
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,227
- Yes?
- When you and I were dating,

46
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,438
did you speak to my secretary
more than you spoke to me?

47
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:29,107
She was one of my bridesmaids.

48
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:33,570
Hmm. Your husband's
a very lucky guy.

49
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,989
- Bye.
- Thanks, bye.

50
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,991
- Do you?
- Absolutely.

51
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,285
- Wonderful.
- He's leaving. Edward's leaving.

52
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,330
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

53
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,500
Is this Mr. Stuckey's car?

54
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,544
Edward,
where you goin'?

55
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,672
- You got the keys to your car?
- Why, what's wrong with the limo?

56
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,424
Look, the limo is buried back
there. Darryl can't get it out.

57
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,468
- Mmm. - Please give me
the keys. - All right, look.

58
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,929
I don't think you should drive. You're
a little excited. Don't drive my car.

59
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,598
Let me work something out here. Fellas,
what kind of a system is this?

60
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,767
Can you move these cars out
of here? Look, Edward.

61
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,812
- Edward. Uh, are you familiar with a stick shift?
- Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,814
- Have you driven a shift? Listen, all right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

63
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,149
Just be ginger with it. It's a new car.

64
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,151
- Don't, uh- Just don't-
- Okay. I can do it.

65
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,153
Edward! Give me a break, please!

66
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,115
- I love this car.
- I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're going.

67
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,284
You're gonna get lost in the dark!

68
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:24,496
Beverly Hills is down the hill!

69
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,294
I don't need
to fall at your feet

70
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,964
Just 'cause you cut me
to the bone

71
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:39,303
- And I won't miss
the way that you kiss me

72
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:44,766
- Oh, shit.
- We were never carved in stone

73
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,479
If I don't listen
to the talk of the town

74
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,483
Then maybe I can fool myself

75
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,529
I'll get over you
I know I will

76
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:01,491
I'll pretend my ship's
not sinking

77
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:06,288
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you

78
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,917
- 'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
- Maps here. Maps.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,253
Have a good one.

80
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,675
What do you say, blondie?
- Hi, honey, want some fun?

81
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,722
- Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?
- Yeah, honey, we're lookin'.

82
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,518
- Here I am.
- I'm Al and this is my friend Bill. Get in the car.

83
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,928
Well, I'm just goin' to school
like I'm real, real cool

84
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,556
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message

85
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,434
And I gotta be a wild one
Ooh, yeah

86
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,437
I'm a wild one

87
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,983
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

88
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,278
Gonna keep on swingin', baby
I'm a real wild child

89
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,953
Now, wait a minute.
You don't seem to understand me.

90
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,999
That's my job. At the end of the month,
I collect everybody's rent.

91
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,752
Now give me the money,
or you're outta here.

92
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,300
Gonna meet all my friends
Gonna have myself a ball

93
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,428
Gonna tell my friends
Gonna tell them all

94
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,805
That I'm a wild one

95
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,683
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wild one

96
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,104
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

97
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:58,483
Gonna keep on swinging, baby
I'm a real wild child

98
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,755
I'm a real wild one
and I like wild fun

99
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,966
In a world going crazy
everything seems hazy

100
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:27,596
I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one

101
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,226
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

102
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,522
Gonna keep on swinging, baby
I'm a real wild child

103
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,149
Welcome to Hollywood!

104
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,318
Everybody comes to Hollywood
got a dream.

105
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,613
What's your dream?
What's your dream?

106
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,991
Hey, mister?
Hey, what's your dream?

107
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,993
Have a good one.

108
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:56,250
- What happened?
- Some chick. She bought it over there.

109
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,169
Detective Albertson. What do
you know about that girl?

110
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,421
I tell you, man. I don't
know who she hang with.

111
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,591
C'mon, guy. We just pulled her out of a
Dumpster in the back. Who was her pimp?

112
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,844
Cocaine her pimp. She a strawberry.

113
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:11,682
She be out on these streets day in, day
out, tradin' her sorry self for some crack.

114
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,184
- And what do you do?
- I cool.

115
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,354
Oh, I'll bet.
Hey, hey, hey! Excuse me! Excuse me!

116
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,107
- What are you, from the press?
- No, no. We're from Orlando.

117
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,318
Oh, I don't believe this. Do you- I
got tourists photographing the body, Al.

118
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,113
What happened?

119
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,127
In a world that can be
so insane

120
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,798
I don't think it's very strange for me
to be in love with you

121
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,261
I wanna know more
than your brain

122
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,263
Hey, Pops, has Kit
been in here?

123
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,391
Upstairs in the poolroom.

124
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,645
Now I smile for your affection
We have made a soul connection

125
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,689
Just for whom
does your bell toll

126
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,650
Don't be cruel
Show me your soul

127
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,652
Yo, Viv!

128
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,739
- Is it all gone?
- Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian.

129
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,367
- This is Angel. That's the Dude.
- I know everybody! Is it all gone, Kit?

130
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,746
Carlos sold me some great shit. We just
had this party. I was the hostess.

131
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,208
I can't believe you bought drugs with
our rent. What is goin' on with you, Kit?

132
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,752
I needed a little pick-me-up.

133
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,837
- Well, we need rent money!
- Oh, calm down, chica.

134
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,881
- She only owes me 200 more.
- Carlos!

135
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,258
- Another $200?
- That was from way before.

136
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,845
That's right, 200, Vivian. But if
you wanna work off her money with me,

137
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:36,016
- we can work something out.
- That's a very sweet offer, Carlos, but not now.

138
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,060
- Come on, Viv. Come downstairs.
- Work out- Work out what?

139
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,522
- What are we gonna work out?
- You really like her, Carlos?

140
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,565
You took it
while I was sleeping?

141
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,984
- You were unavailable for consultation.
- Hey, let's go.

142
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:49,112
Snack! Snack!

143
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,783
- Besides, it's my apartment.
- Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.

144
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,869
Look, you came here; I gave you some
money; I gave you a place to stay...

145
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,205
and some valuable
vocational advice.

146
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,207
He was on my case.
I had to give him something.

147
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,376
So don't irritate me.

148
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,712
- This ain't a buffet, Kit.
- Irritate you?

149
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:09,716
Irritate you? I just saw a girl
pulled out of a Dumpster.

150
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,054
I know. Skinny Marie.
But... she was a- a flake.

151
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,224
She was a crack head. Dominic was trying
to straighten her out for months.

152
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,894
Leave her alone!

153
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,938
Don't you want
to get outta here?

154
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,067
Get outta where?
Where the fuck you wanna go?

155
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,570
Aah, nothin' but garbage.

156
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,322
- Uh, excuse me.
- Huh?

157
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,325
- Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
- You're here!

158
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,579
That's Sylvester Stallone's
house right there.

159
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,498
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

160
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,586
- Hey, yo, Rachel.
- What?

161
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,131
- Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe?
- Yeah.

162
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,551
Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope,
we work the Ritz Brothers,

163
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,971
we work Fred Astaire, we work all
the way down to Ella Fitzgerald.

164
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,474
This is our turf. We got seniority.
You better get off our corner.

165
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,811
Forgive me. I was just takin'
a rest here. Besides, she's new.

166
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:07,149
Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up
by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson.

167
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,359
- Williams.
- Esther Williams! Where you belong!

168
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:13,030
Back off, Kit. You know,
you're really becoming a grouch.

169
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,325
- Am I really a grouch?
- Yes.

170
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,327
Sometimes.

171
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,663
Well, just 'cause I'm hungry.
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

172
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:25,042
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, yo, baby!

173
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,127
How about a freebie?
It's my birthday.

174
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,171
Dream on!

175
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,467
It's lookin'
really slow tonight.

176
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,223
Yeah, well... maybe we should get a
pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you.

177
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,351
And then he'll run our lives
and take our money. No.

178
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:45,979
You're right. We say who,
we say when, we say how much.

179
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,360
- Do you think I look like Carol Channing?
- No! I love this look.

180
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,155
It's very glamorous. Glamour choice.

181
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,157
Oh, yo, oh, yo.
Catch this!

182
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,912
Wait a minute.
That's a Lotus Esprit.

183
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,835
No, that's rent. You should go for him.
You look hot tonight.

184
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,547
Don't take less than a hundred. Call me
when you're through. Take care of you.

185
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,675
Take care of you.

186
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,180
Work it. Work it, baby.
Work it!

187
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,850
Work it. Own it.

188
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,019
Yes, you can handle this.

189
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:29,189
First is here somewhere.

190
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,025
Hey, sugar, you lookin'
for a date?

191
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,695
No, I wanna find Beverly Hills.
Can you give me directions?

192
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,364
Sure. For five bucks.

193
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,034
- Ridiculous.
- Price just went up to ten.

194
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,079
You can't charge me
for directions.

195
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,790
I can do anything I want to,
baby. I ain't lost.

196
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,755
All right, okay?

197
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:57,092
All right. You win, I lose.
Got change for a 20?

198
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,888
For 20, I'll show you personal.
Even show you where the stars live.

199
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:06,393
- Oh, that's all right. I already been to Stallone's.
- Right. Uh, down the street.

200
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,940
Lights! Lights would be good here.

201
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:15,095
It's a little, a little temperamental.

202
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,488
Yours?
No,it isn't

203
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,239
Stolen?

204
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,449
Not Exactly

205
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,368
What's your name?

206
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,663
What do you want it to be?

207
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:33,211
- Vivian. My name is Vivian.
- Vivian.

208
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,173
- So, what hotel you stayin' at?
- The, uh, Regent Beverly Wilshire.

209
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,800
Down the block,
right at the corner.

210
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:49,852
Man, this baby must corner
like it's on rails!

211
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,854
I beg your pardon?

212
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,857
Well, doesn't it blow your mind?
This is only four cylinders.

213
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,277
- You know about cars.
Where did that come from?

214
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,988
Road and Track. The boys
back home I grew up with,

215
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,991
they were really into American
heavy metal: Mustangs, Corvettes.

216
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,828
- Ah.
- They bought 'em cheap and fixed 'em up. I paid attention.

217
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,497
So how is it you know
so little about cars?

218
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,667
My first car
was a limousine.

219
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,127
- Oh.
- So where is this...

220
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:19,173
heavy metal... home?

221
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,009
Millage Ville, Georgia.

222
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,178
You know, I think you left
your transmission back there.

223
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,848
- You're not shifting right.
This is a standard "H."

224
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,350
Standard "H." Like I know
what that means.

225
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:33,688
Have you ever driven a Lotus?

226
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,357
- No.
- You're gonna start right now.

227
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:41,654
- You're joking.
- No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.

228
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,035
Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you
for the ride of your life.

229
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,205
- I'm gonna show you what this car can really do. Are you ready?
- I am ready.

230
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,876
- Hang on. -
Okay. - Here we go.

231
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,925
This has pedals like a race car.
They're really close together.

232
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:07,889
So it's probably easier for a woman to
drive, 'cause they have little feet.

233
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,891
Except me.
I wear a size nine.

234
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,561
You know your foot's as big as
your arm from your elbow to your wrist?

235
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,563
Did you know that?

236
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:20,234
- No, I didn't know that.
- It's a little bit of trivia.

237
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:27,200
Tell me, what kind of- what kind of
money you girls make these days?

238
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,202
Ballpark.

239
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:32,038
Can't take less than $100.

240
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,541
- A hundred dollars a night.
- For an hour.

241
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,585
An hour?

242
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:41,255
You make $100 an hour and you got
a safety pin holding your boot up?

243
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,257
You gotta be joking.

244
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:47,386
- I never joke about money.
- Neither do I.

245
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,389
Hundred dollars an hour.

246
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,309
Pretty stiff.

247
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:59,690
Well, no.
But it's got potential.

248
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,709
Good evening, Mr. Lewis.

249
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,878
Will you be needing the car
anymore tonight?

250
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,424
I- I hope not!

251
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:29,428
Ah. We're here.

252
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,348
Yeah.

253
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,811
So you'll be all right?

254
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:40,565
Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab
with my twenty bucks.

255
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:44,986
- Go back to your office.
- Yeah.

256
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,530
My office. Yeah.

257
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:51,534
Well, thanks for the ride.

258
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,454
- See you.
- Good-bye.

259
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,678
No taxis?

260
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,390
No, I like the bus.

261
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,521
I was thinking-
Did you really say $100 an hour?

262
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,441
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

263
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,944
Well, if you don't have
any prior engagements,

264
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,573
I'd be very pleased if you would
accompany me into the hotel.

265
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,534
You got it.

266
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,997
What is your name?

267
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,667
- Edward.
- Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world!

268
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,629
- No!
- I tell you what, this is fate, Edward.

269
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,216
That's what this is.

270
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:52,094
- Why don't you put this on?
- Why?

271
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:57,099
Well, this hotel is not the kind of
establishment that rents rooms by the hour.

272
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,061
Ah.

273
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:08,569
- Wow!
- It's all right.

274
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,991
- Holy shit.
- You're gonna be fine.

275
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:18,538
Come with me.
And stop fidgeting.

276
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,499
- Good evening, Mr. Lewis.
- Hello. You have messages?

277
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,710
- Yes, we have several.
- Thank you.

278
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,385
- Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please?
- Of course.

279
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,721
Room service
for Mr. Lewis, please.

280
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,109
Oh, honey.

281
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,989
You know what's happened?
I've got a runner in my pantyhose.

282
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,825
I'm not wearing pantyhose.

283
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,542
Well, color me happy!
There's a sofa in here for two.

284
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:09,547
- First time in an elevator.
- Ah.

285
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:13,009
Close your mouth, dear.

286
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,471
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

287
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,391
Try.

288
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,274
- Penthouse.
- The penthouse.

289
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,818
- Yes.
- Mmm.

290
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,779
- To the left.
- Oh.

291
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:53,341
Oh, I miss keys.

292
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,357
Impressed?

293
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,859
You kidding me?
I come here all the time.

294
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,281
- As a matter of fact, they do rent this room by the hour.
- Sure they do.

295
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,117
Wow, great view!

296
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:24,330
- I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here.
- I'll take your word for it.

297
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,667
- I don't go out there.
- Why don't you go out there?

298
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:31,170
- I'm afraid of heights.
- You are?

299
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,422
So how come you
rented the penthouse?

300
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:37,385
It's the best. I looked all around
for penthouses on the first floor,

301
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,346
but I can't find one.

302
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:46,060
Well, now that you have me here,
what are you going to do with me?

303
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,730
- Want to know something? I don't have a clue.
- No?

304
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,066
I hadn't exactly planned this.

305
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,861
Well, do you plan everything?

306
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:58,739
- Always.
- Yeah. Me too.

307
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,201
I'm actually- No, I'm not a planner.
I wouldn't say I was a planner.

308
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:06,247
I would say I was, um, a kind of
"fly by the seat of my pants" gal.

309
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:11,377
You know, moment to moment.
That's me. That's- Yeah.

310
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:16,007
Mm-hmm. You know,
you could pay me.

311
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,092
That's one way
to maybe break the ice.

312
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:22,847
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

313
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:26,100
Cash works for me, yeah.

314
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,027
You're on my fax.

315
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:40,573
Well, that's one I haven't
been on before.

316
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,951
Cute. She's very cute. Thank you.

317
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,454
All right. Here we go.

318
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,248
Pick one. I got red,
I got green, I got yellow.

319
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,460
I'm out of purple, but I do
have one gold circle coin left.

320
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:56,631
The condom of champions. The one and only.
Nothing is gettin' through this sucker.

321
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,467
- What d'you say? Hmm?
- A buffet of safety.

322
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,887
I'm a safety girl.

323
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,100
- All right, let's get
one of these on you.

324
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,978
No. I-

325
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,483
Why don't we just talk
for a little bit, okay?

326
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:21,072
Talk. Yeah... uh... okay.

327
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:26,244
Edward, are you in town
on, uh, business or pleasure?

328
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:29,455
- Business, I think.
- Business, you think.

329
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:34,252
Well... let me guess.

330
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:38,506
That would make you...
a lawyer.

331
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,467
- A lawyer.
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:45,096
- What makes you think I'm a lawyer?
- You've got that, um...

333
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,765
sharp, useless look
about you.

334
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:51,352
I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

335
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,021
I've known a lot
of everybody.

336
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:59,944
What is that?

337
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:03,281
- Champagne.
- Oh! Well.

338
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,784
Might as well
make myself useful.

339
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:11,497
Take a load off.

340
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:18,421
- Good evening.
- Hi.

341
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:22,967
- Uh, where would you like it?
- Where would we like it?

342
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:26,012
Uh, over by the bar.

343
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,562
Excuse me!

344
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,564
It'll be on your bill,
Mr. Lewis.

345
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,483
Thank you.

346
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,237
What are you lookin' at?

347
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:48,618
- What is he lookin' at?
- Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

348
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,620
Thank you very much, sir.
Have a nice night.

349
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:54,624
A tip. Wow.
I missed that one. Oh.

350
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,667
- Stupid.
- Don't worry about it.

351
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,794
- You mind if I take my boots off?
- Not at all.

352
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:04,091
- So, do you have a wife? Girlfriend?
- I have both.

353
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,970
Where are they? Shopping together?

354
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:13,726
My ex-wife... is now in Long Island...
in my ex-home...

355
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:17,355
with my ex-dog.

356
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:24,028
There you go. My ex-girlfriend,
Jessica, is in New York...

357
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:28,908
moving out of my apartment
even as we speak.

358
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,791
Why don't you try a strawberry?

359
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:41,128
- Why?
- It brings out the flavor in the champagne.

360
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:44,048
Oh, groovy.

361
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:53,724
Pretty good.

362
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:59,230
- Don't you drink?
- No.

363
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:05,611
Listen, I- I appreciate this whole
seduction scene you've got goin',

364
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,364
but let me give you a tip:
I'm a sure thing, okay?

365
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,367
So, I'm on an hourly rate.
Could we just move it along?

366
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:14,579
Somehow I'm sensing that this time
problem is a major issue with you.

367
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,581
Why don't we just
get through that right now?

368
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:20,209
- Great, let's get started.
- How much for the entire night?

369
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:24,380
Stay here?

370
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,799
You couldn't afford it.

371
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,761
- Try me.
- $300.

372
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:35,850
Done. Thank you.
Now we can relax.

373
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,570
I'll be out in just a minute.
That champagne kind of got to me.

374
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,572
- I didn't hear you. What did you say?
- Uh...

375
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:52,450
I said I'd be out
in just a minute.

376
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,744
What is- What do you have
in, uh, your hand there?

377
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:59,081
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

378
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,753
All right, look.
I do not want any drugs here.

379
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:06,631
I don't want any of this. Get your
things and your money and please leave.

380
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,841
I don't do drugs, all right?
I- I stopped doing drugs when I was 14.

381
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:13,012
What is this?
What is this?

382
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:17,600
- This is dental floss.
- Yeah? So?

383
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:23,648
I had all those strawberry seeds.
And you shouldn't neglect your gums.

384
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,859
I'm sorry.
Please continue.

385
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,779
Thank you.

386
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:39,747
- Are you gonna watch?
- No, I'm going.

387
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,002
Thank you.

388
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:48,923
It's just that, uh,
very few people surprise me.

389
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:53,594
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
Most of 'em shock the hell outta me.

390
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:00,935
- You're watching.
- I'm going.

391
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:17,326
Yes, that may be true, Vance.

392
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:21,581
Yes, I know, but I still need
the numbers on Morse Industries.

393
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,250
Uh-huh.
I've got 'em from London;

394
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,419
I need 'em now from Tokyo.

395
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,089
I'll call down and get them when
I want them. Thank you very much.

396
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,678
I have a little carpet picnic here.
Are you sure you don't want a drink?

397
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,515
I'm high on life. Can't you tell?

398
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,154
You know, I never
saw this episode.

399
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:37,049
What do you want?

400
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,177
What do you do?

401
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:41,846
Everything.

402
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,890
But I don't kiss on the mouth.

403
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:47,518
Neither do I.

404
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,664
- Hey, how you doing there?
- All right.

405
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:52,041
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

406
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,585
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

407
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,587
- Good morning, Mr. Thompson.
- Good morning, Marjorie.

408
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,048
Of course Morse is going to fight.
It's to be expected.

409
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,133
He's run his company
for a very long time now.

410
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,970
I don't think he's ready to have
his name taken off the stationery.

411
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,305
He wants to meet you
face to face.

412
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:09,100
- I wouldn't do it.
- Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow.

413
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,102
Tonight. Dinner. Set it up.

414
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:14,021
Oh, Edward, Edward. I- Look, it's
really not a good idea that you see him.

415
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:17,316
Definitely not alone.
You know? He's a feisty old guy.

416
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:20,027
You know, we say the wrong thing,
we could wind up in court.

417
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,488
Well, you know, there's always a
possibility things are gonna go wrong.

418
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:27,702
That's why I enjoy this so much.
Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car.

419
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:31,455
- Oh, God. What?
- It corners like it's on rails.

420
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:36,127
What? What does
that mean? Edward? Edward!

421
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,172
Hi.

422
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,674
Well, good morning.

423
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:43,676
Red.

424
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:46,554
Better.

425
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,808
Y- You didn't wake me.
I can see you're really busy.

426
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:54,228
- I'm gonna be outta here in just a minute.
- No, there's no hurry.

427
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,230
Are you hungry?
You must be.

428
00:30:56,231 --> 00:31:00,318
Why don't you sit
and have something to eat?

429
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:04,906
I, uh, took the liberty
of ordering everything on the menu.

430
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:07,408
I didn't know what you'd like.

431
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,661
- Thanks.
- All right? Good.

432
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:17,335
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah, too good.

433
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:20,838
- I forgot where I was.
- Occupational hazard?

434
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:24,926
Yeah. Did you sleep?

435
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:29,305
Uh, yes, a little,
on the couch.

436
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,349
I was, uh, working
last night.

437
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,809
You don't sleep,
you don't do drugs,

438
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,355
you don't drink,
you hardly eat.

439
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:40,233
What do you do, Edward?
'Cause I know you're not a lawyer.

440
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,818
That's right.

441
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:46,030
There are four
other chairs here.

442
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,033
Oh.

443
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:56,207
- So what do you do?
- I buy companies.

444
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,543
What kind of companies?

445
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:03,381
Uh, I buy companies that are
in financial difficulty.

446
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,883
If they have problems, you must
get 'em for a bargain, huh?

447
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,719
Well, the company
I'm buying this week,

448
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,473
I'm getting for the bargain
price of about one billion.

449
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,477
- A billion dollars?
- Yes.

450
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:19,146
Wow. You must be
really smart, huh?

451
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,734
I only got through
the eleventh grade.

452
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:27,572
How far did you go
in school?

453
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:31,200
I went all the way.

454
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:37,039
Your folks must be
really proud, huh?

455
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:47,592
So you don't actually
have a billion dollars, huh?

456
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:51,345
No, I get some of it
from banks, investors.

457
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,848
It's not an easy thing to do.

458
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:57,643
- And you don't make anything and you don't build anything.
- No. No.

459
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,521
- So what do you do with the companies once you buy them?
- I sell them.

460
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,566
Here, let me do that.
You sell them.

461
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:07,153
Well, I... don't sell the whole company;
I break it up into pieces...

462
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,655
and then I sell that off;
it's worth more than the whole.

463
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:15,119
So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars
and selling 'em for the parts, right?

464
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,956
- Yeah, sort of. But legal.
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,292
There. See, now it's perfect.

466
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:25,254
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Where'd you learn to do that?

467
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:29,467
Well, I screwed the debate team
in high school.

468
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:34,805
I had a grandpa! He was nice to me.
He liked ties on Sundays.

469
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:37,642
Mind if I, um, take a swim
in your tub before I go?

470
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:42,063
Not at all. Just stay
in the shallow end.

471
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:46,067
- Hello?
- Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.

472
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,319
I just wanted to let you know,
Morse is all set for tonight.

473
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,321
- Oh, that's good.
- He's bringing his grandson.

474
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,573
He's grooming him
to take over. I don't know.

475
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:57,370
Ah, yes. Very intense young man
named David. He plays polo.

476
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,790
Look, I gotta say this again.
I don't like you goin' alone.

477
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,876
I just want your extra time and your

478
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:07,547
Look, I just think it'd be better
if you- if you went with a date.

479
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,883
You know? Keep it social.

480
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:14,387
- Edward? Did you hear me?
- Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.

481
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,973
- If you want to impress me
- What is that?

482
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:18,975
- Oh
- Housekeeping is singing.

483
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:22,103
Got to be
too flirty, Mama

484
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:25,356
- I know how to undress me
- Yeah... listen.

485
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:28,860
- Edward, I know a lot of nice girls.
- No, you don't.

486
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:32,822
I just want your extra time
and your

487
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:35,449
Kiss

488
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,204
- Besides, I already have one.
- If you want to impress me

489
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:44,750
You just concentrate on finding out
what Morse is up to. I'm on my way.

490
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:49,714
I know how to undress me
Mm-hmm, yeah, baby

491
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:53,801
I want to be your fantasy

492
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:56,929
Well, maybe
you could be mine

493
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,640
Mm-hmm
You just leave it

494
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:03,227
All up to me

495
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,731
Don't you just love Prince?

496
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:09,984
- More than life itself.
- Don't you knock?

497
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:13,404
Vivian, I have a business
proposition for you.

498
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:16,240
- What do you want?
- I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.

499
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,327
I'd like you to spend
the week with me.

500
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:23,080
- Really?
- Yes.

501
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:25,583
Yes, I'd like to hire you
as an employee.

502
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:30,421
- Would you consider spending
the week with me?

503
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:34,342
I will pay you
to be at my beck and call.

504
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:36,802
Look, I'd love to be your
"beck and call girl,"

505
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,639
but you're a rich,
good-lookin' guy.

506
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,058
You could get
a million girls free.

507
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,435
I want a professional.

508
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:48,856
I don't need any romantic
hassles this week.

509
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:52,360
If you're talkin' 24 hours
a day, it's gonna cost you.

510
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:55,530
Oh, yes, of course!

511
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:58,074
All right, here we go.

512
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,284
Give me a ballpark figure.
How much?

513
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:04,997
Six full nights, days too.

514
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:09,460
- Four thousand.
- Six nights at 300 is 1,800.

515
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,963
- You want days too.
- Two thousand.

516
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,131
- Three thousand.
- Done.

517
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:19,929
Holy shit!

518
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,431
Vivian.

519
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,726
Vivian, is that a yes?

520
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:31,858
Yes.
Yes!

521
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,278
I'll be gone most of the day.
I want you to buy some clothes.

522
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:38,364
- You really should think about traveler's checks.
- We may be going out evenings.

523
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:41,200
- You'll need something to wear.
- Like what?

524
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,537
Uh, nothing too flashy.
Not too sexy.

525
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:47,999
- Conservative. You understand?
- Boring.

526
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,835
Elegant. Any questions?

527
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:54,005
- Can I call you Eddie?
- Not if you expect me to answer.

528
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:57,341
I would've stayed for 2,000.

529
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,094
I would've paid four.

530
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,180
- I'll see you tonight.
- Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice,

531
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:06,017
you're never gonna
wanna let me go.

532
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:12,481
Three thousand for six days.
And, Vivian, I will let you go.

533
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:19,197
But I'm here now.

534
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:34,420
Three thousand dollars!

535
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,051
Ooh.

536
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:46,098
Hello?

537
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,643
I called and called.
Where were you last night?

538
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,728
- Ma?
- It's Viv.

539
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:53,397
Oh. Hi. I had to party.
Where are you?

540
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,983
Oh, man. Are you ready
for this? The guy?

541
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,570
The Lotus? I am in his hotel room
in Beverly Hills.

542
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:03,074
The penthouse. His bathroom is bigger
than the Blue Banana!

543
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,284
Do I have to hear this?

544
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:08,496
Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week.
And you know what he's gonna give me?

545
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,540
Guess. You'll never guess.

546
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,417
- Three thousand dollars.
- Bullshit!

547
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:16,003
I swear to God.
And extra money to buy clothes.

548
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:19,715
Oh, man! I am bummed.
I gave that guy to you!

549
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,301
Three thousand. Really?
Is he twisted?

550
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:25,012
- No. - Ugly? -
He's good-looking!

551
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,181
- Well, what's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

552
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:30,852
- Did he give you the money yet? - At the end
of the week. - That's what's wrong with him.

553
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:33,729
Well, he gave me 300
for last night. And, Kit?

554
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,691
I'm gonna leave some at the front desk
for you. I want you to pick it up.

555
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,736
I'm at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Write it down.

556
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:43,990
Are you writing it down?
You'll forget it. Write it down.

557
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:47,827
Reg... Bev... Wil.

558
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:51,539
Now, one more thing. Where do I go
for the clothes? Good stuff, on him.

559
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,541
- In Beverly Hills?
- Yeah.

560
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,960
Rodeo Drive, baby.

561
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,550
- Hi.
- Yes, ma'am. May I help you?

562
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:06,429
Yeah, I'm leaving this here for
Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up.

563
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,514
- Don't open that.
- No, ma'am.

564
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:15,146
- Grazie.
- Arrivederci.

565
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,901
Miss Wilson,
do you know that lady?

566
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:22,069
No, sir.

567
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,280
Wild women do

568
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:29,035
And they don't regret it

569
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:35,416
Wild women show
what they're goin' through

570
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,710
Ooh

571
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:44,926
Wild women do
what you think you'll never

572
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:51,599
What you only dream about
wild women do

573
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:56,062
Oh, yes, they do

574
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,733
You tell me you
want a woman who

575
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:04,612
Is simple as a flower

576
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:08,074
Well, if you want me
to act like that

577
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:12,453
You've got to pay me
by the hour

578
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:19,627
Wild women do
and they don't regret it

579
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:22,964
Oh, wild women show

580
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:28,636
What they're goin' through
Ooh, yeah

581
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:32,306
Wild women do
what you think you'll never

582
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:36,143
- May I help you?
- I'm just checkin' things out.

583
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:38,479
Are you looking for something
in particular?

584
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,192
No. Well, yeah.
Something... conservative.

585
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:46,154
Yes.

586
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,991
- You got nice stuff.
- Thank you.

587
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:53,327
- How much is this?
- I don't think this would fit you.

588
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:57,582
Well, I didn't ask if it would fit.
I asked how much it was.

589
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:59,584
How much is this, Marie?

590
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,961
It's very expensive.

591
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:06,299
- It's very expensive.
- Look, I got money to spend in here.

592
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,177
I don't think
we have anything for you.

593
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,179
You're obviously
in the wrong place.

594
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,473
Please leave.

595
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:33,451
Doctor's office?
Two blocks down and to your left.

596
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:36,370
Thank you.

597
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:45,087
Tiffany is taking the corner
space; they like the project.

598
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,423
We're very excited
about the whole thing.

599
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,800
Did you realize that Via Rodeo
is the first new street...

600
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,513
in Beverly Hills in 75 years?

601
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,016
- Excuse me, miss, may I help you?
- I'm going to my room.

602
00:41:57,017 --> 00:42:00,603
- Uh, do you have a key?
- Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing.

603
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:03,272
- I'm on the top floor.
- You're a guest here?

604
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:06,400
- I'm with a friend.
- And who would that be?

605
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:08,736
- Edward.
- Edward?

606
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:12,323
Edward... Edward, uh-

607
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:16,577
- He knows me.
- Dennis.

608
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:19,539
Dennis, did you just come
off the night shift? Hmm?

609
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,124
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know this young lady?

610
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,752
- She's with Mr. Lewis.
- Mr. Lewis.

611
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,630
That's it. Edward Lewis!
Thanks, Dennis.

612
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:31,384
- Evidently she joined him last night.
- Thank you.

613
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:35,012
Oh, God! What now? What? What?

614
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,348
- What is with everybody today?
- No, no. It's all right. Just come with me.

615
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,600
- We'll have a little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you.
- I'm coming.

616
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:42,895
- Uh, what is your name, miss?
- What do you want it to be?

617
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:46,149
- Don't play with me, young lady.
- Vivian.

618
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,442
Thank you. Vivian.

619
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:51,612
Well, Miss Vivian.

620
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:56,117
Things that go on in other hotels don't
happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

621
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,995
Now, Mr. Lewis, however,
is a very special customer,

622
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:02,123
and we like to think of our
special customers as friends.

623
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:06,961
Now, as a customer, we would expect Mr.
Lewis to sign in any additional guests,

624
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:09,297
but as a friend,
we're willing to overlook it.

625
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:13,384
Now, I'm assuming
that you're a-

626
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:16,470
- Relative?
- Yes.

627
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:21,309
I thought so.
Then you must be his-

628
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,811
Niece?

629
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:30,359
Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis
leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.

630
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:34,489
I assume you have
no other uncles here.

631
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:37,950
Good! Then we understand each other.
I would also encourage you...

632
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:40,912
to dress a little more
appropriately; that'll be all.

633
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:43,664
No, that's not all. That's what
I was trying to do. I tried to go...

634
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:46,626
get a dress on Rodeo Drive today,
and the women wouldn't help me.

635
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,794
And I have all this money
now and no dress!

636
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,589
Not that I expect you to help me,
but I have all of this, okay?

637
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,966
I have to buy a dress
for dinner tonight.

638
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:57,637
And nobody will help me.

639
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:11,108
Oh, man, if you're
callin' the cops.

640
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:14,946
Yeah, call the cops.
That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.

641
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:17,198
Women's clothing.

642
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,284
Bridget, please.

643
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:34,006
Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard
Thompson here at the Regent Beverly Wil-

644
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:38,803
Thank you, yes, but I'd
like you to do a favor for me, please.

645
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:41,222
I'm sending someone over.
Her name is Vivian.

646
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:43,391
She's a special guest.

647
00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:48,187
She's the niece
of a very special guest.

648
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,107
Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown:

649
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:54,110
prime industrial property straddling
the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.

650
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:57,947
The real estate possibilities are endless,
but most of the yard we'll just level.

651
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:00,783
We just got the information,
Mr. Stuckey.

652
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:04,704
Edward, we just got the Morse update.
Don, can you hold the projection, please?

653
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:07,498
Yeah, what? Speak.

654
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:12,753
Old Man Morse just got the inside track
on a $350 million contract...

655
00:45:12,754 --> 00:45:14,839
to build destroyers for the Navy.

656
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,841
Navy contract.
I can't believe this.

657
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:20,845
- You said they had nothing in the hopper on this one!
- I thought they didn't.

658
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:22,847
Hey, you know, if that's true
it could cost a lot more.

659
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:24,849
Those stocks could go
through the roof.

660
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:29,145
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
- Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir.

661
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:31,772
- See, we can still walk away from it.
- Walk away?

662
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:33,816
Hey, forget it, pal. We got
a thousand man-hours in on this!

663
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:36,319
- Nobody's walkin' away from anything!
- Philip, I think he's right.

664
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,779
Gentlemen, relax!

665
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,117
Relax! Who do we know on
the Senate Appropriations Committee?

666
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:45,286
Senator Adams.

667
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:47,330
All right, Senator Adams.
Let's find out where he is.

668
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:52,210
The Navy's not gonna spend $350 million on
anything without going to Appropriations first.

669
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:54,504
- I don't understand what's goin' on here today, gentlemen.
- Hello?

670
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:57,298
That's why I hired you,
Phil, to do my worrying for me.

671
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:59,383
I'll be in your office. Bob, if you
want to send over the geologicals?

672
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:02,386
- No problem. -
Thank you. - Edward.

673
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:06,140
- Listen, everything all set for
the meeting tonight? - Mm-hmm.

674
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:09,435
Who- Who is this girl
you're going with?

675
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:11,437
Nobody you know.

676
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:14,315
Yes,
Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey.

677
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,317
Yes, I have him right here.

678
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:19,946
- Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes in.
- Thank you.

679
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:23,282
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

680
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:30,289
Hello. You must be Vivian.
My name's Bridget.

681
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,084
- Yeah, hi. Barney said
you'd be nice to me.

682
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:37,505
He's very sweet. What are your plans
while you're in town?

683
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,632
- We're gonna have dinner.
- Oh, don't sit on there, dear!

684
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:42,426
- You're gonna go out? Dinner?
- Mm-hmm.

685
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:45,513
Well, you'll need a cocktail dress
then. Come with me.

686
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:48,683
Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something
here that your uncle will love.

687
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:52,311
- You're a size six, right?
- Yeah. How'd you know that?

688
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,731
- Oh, that's my job.
- Bridg, he's not really my uncle.

689
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:58,109
They never are, dear.

690
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:03,406
Barney! Sorry, mister.

691
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:05,658
I got a dress!

692
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,660
Well, I'd rather hoped
you'd be wearing it.

693
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:09,996
Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed
up! Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see?

694
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,707
No, that won't be necessary. I'm
sure they're quite lovely. Thank you.

695
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,917
Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to
interrupt you, but Bridget was really great...

696
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,919
and I just wanted
to say thanks.

697
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,631
- You're cool.
- You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

698
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:27,763
Hello?

699
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:29,974
Never, ever pick up the phone.

700
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:33,311
- Then why are you calling me?
- Did you buy clothes today?

701
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:35,855
- I got a dress. A cocktail one.
- That's good.

702
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:38,107
I'll be in the hotel lobby,
7:45 sharp.

703
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,109
What? You're not comin'
up to the door?

704
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,111
This isn't a date.
It's business.

705
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:44,238
Where are you takin' me,
anyway?

706
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:46,407
I'm taking you to a restaurant
called the Voltaire.

707
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:48,868
- Very elegant.
- All right.

708
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,996
I'll meet you in the lobby, but
only 'cause you're payin' me to.

709
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:55,291
Well, thank you very much.

710
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:59,504
Get her back for me,
please.

711
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:05,426
- Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you.
- Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone call.

712
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:07,845
Hello?

713
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:11,557
- I told you not to pick up the phone.
- Then stop callin' me.

714
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:17,146
Sick.

715
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:21,400
- Barney!
- It didn't fit.

716
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:25,404
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Uh- I've got a little problem.

717
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,406
All right, Miss Vivian,
one more time.

718
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:31,702
- Dinner napkin.
- Dinner napkin, laid gently in the lap.

719
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:36,165
Good. Elbows off the table.
Don't slouch.

720
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,543
Shrimp fork,

721
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:41,504
salad fork, dinner fork.

722
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,506
I definitely have
the salad fork.

723
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,342
The rest of the silverware
is a little confusing.

724
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:48,845
All right, if you get nervous,
just count the tines.

725
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:51,180
Four tines: dinner fork.

726
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:57,353
And sometimes there are three tines
in the salad fork. And sometimes-

727
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:12,869
Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson.
I'm the manager of the hotel.

728
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,204
- Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want
to make one call. - Yes, um, sir.

729
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:17,832
- I have a message for you, sir.
- From who?

730
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:21,043
- From your niece, sir.
- My what?

731
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:23,629
The young lady who's staying
with you in your room, sir.

732
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:27,383
Oh. Hmm.

733
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:30,553
- I think we both know that she's not my niece.
- Of course.

734
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:33,097
The reason I know that is
that I am an only child.

735
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:36,225
- Yes, sir.
- What's the message?

736
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:38,227
She's waiting for you
in the lounge.

737
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:42,690
Intriguing young lady,
Miss Vivian.

738
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:46,611
- Intriguing.
- Have a good evening, sir.

739
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:52,450
- Thank you, Mr. -? - Thompson. I'm
the manager- manager of the hotel, sir.

740
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,863
You're late.

741
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:32,949
You're stunning.

742
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,285
You're forgiven.

743
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:40,373
Shall we go to dinner?

744
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:56,514
- This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.
- Stop fidgeting.

745
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:02,603
- Mr. Morse.
- Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

746
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:07,233
This fireball is my grandson,
David.

747
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,777
Well, I don't know about the fireball
part, but grandson is true enough.

748
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:12,738
I'm pleased to meet you both.
This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

749
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:16,826
- Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.
- Mr. Morse. David.

750
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,745
Please, sit.

751
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:26,919
Excuse me.

752
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,425
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ladies' room.

753
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,471
- Upstairs, to the right.
- Okay. Excuse me.

754
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:41,684
- Shall I order for you?
- Yeah.

755
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,686
Please do so. Thank you.

756
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:46,647
I'll do that.

757
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,531
Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes
the men who create a company...

758
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:59,327
- should control its destiny.
- Where's the salad?

759
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,914
Uh, the salad comes
at the end of the meal.

760
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:06,375
That's the fork I knew.

761
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,212
Let me, uh, put it another way.

762
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:12,590
Between your public statements and the
rumors flying around on this thing,

763
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:15,468
we find it very hard to figure out what
your real intentions are.

764
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:19,388
I don't know about you, but I've never
been able to figure which goes with what!

765
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:38,491
You know, there was a time when
we built ships the size of cities.

766
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:41,786
- Men like my grandfather made this country.
- Who ordered this?

767
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:44,038
The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appetite.

768
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:47,834
These are escargot. It's French
for snails. It's a delicacy.

769
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:50,837
Try it. David?

770
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:55,216
Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control-
and I don't think you will- but if you did,

771
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:58,177
what do you plan to do
with the company?

772
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,304
Break it up
and sell off the pieces.

773
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:03,349
I'm sure you'll understand
I'm not thrilled at the idea...

774
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:08,020
of your turning 40 years of my work
into your garage sale.

775
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:11,232
At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr.
Morse, you are going to be a very rich man.

776
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:16,571
I'm rich enough. I just want
to head my shipyard.

777
00:53:18,157 --> 00:53:21,993
Slippery little suckers.

778
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:26,831
It happens all the time.

779
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:30,418
I met your father.
What's his name?

780
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:35,214
- Carter.
- Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.

781
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:37,800
He's not quite the bastard
everybody says he is.

782
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:41,220
- No, I have the franchise on that.
- Does that make him proud?

783
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:46,058
I doubt it. It doesn't
really matter now. He passed away.

784
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:48,728
Oh, I hadn't heard.
I'm sorry.

785
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:50,730
I'm sorry too.

786
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:54,567
Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting.
What can I do for you?

787
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:59,572
- Leave my company alone.
- I can't do that. I own ten million shares.

788
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:02,575
- I'll buy your stock back.
- You don't have the money.

789
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:05,244
We will; we're getting a contract
to build ten destroyers.

790
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:08,706
There will be no contract. The contract
is now buried in Appropriations Committee.

791
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:12,251
- And it will remain there.
- And how the hell did you pull something like that?

792
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:14,295
You got dirty politicians in
your pockets now or something?

793
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:16,797
Easy, easy,
calm down. Calm down, David.

794
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:21,010
- Mr. Lewis plays hardball.
- Yes, yes, I do.

795
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:24,639
I've heard enough of this. Vivian,
it was a great pleasure to meet you.

796
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,227
I'm sorry, Grandfather.
I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis.

797
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:32,271
I'd better join my grandson.
You two enjoy your dinner.

798
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:36,567
I'm sure it'll be delicious.
Good luck, miss.

799
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:40,905
Watch out, Lewis.
I'm gonna tear you apart.

800
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:44,368
I look forward to it, sir.

801
00:54:53,212 --> 00:54:55,422
Edward?

802
00:54:57,892 --> 00:55:00,311
Edward, you said you never
come out here.

803
00:55:00,394 --> 00:55:04,065
Well, I'm only halfway out.

804
00:55:04,148 --> 00:55:07,902
Didn't say much in the car
on the way home.

805
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:11,531
You thinkin' about dinner?
I was a maniac.

806
00:55:11,614 --> 00:55:15,159
I mean, the business
was good, I think. You know?

807
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:18,746
He's in trouble.
You want his company.

808
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,748
He doesn't want
to let it go.

809
00:55:20,832 --> 00:55:23,042
Thanks for the recap.

810
00:55:23,084 --> 00:55:26,921
The problem is, I think
you liked Mr. Morse.

811
00:55:26,963 --> 00:55:30,216
I'd like for you to get down from there;
you're making me very nervous.

812
00:55:30,258 --> 00:55:33,678
It's making you nervous? What if I just
leaned back a little bit like this?

813
00:55:33,761 --> 00:55:35,721
Would you- Would you
rescue me if I fell?

814
00:55:35,763 --> 00:55:37,765
Vivian, I'm serious.
Come- I'm not looking.

815
00:55:37,849 --> 00:55:41,769
It's really high. Look, no hands,
no hands! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

816
00:55:43,855 --> 00:55:49,652
The truth is, it really is totally
irrelevant whether I like this man or not.

817
00:55:49,735 --> 00:55:53,114
I will not let myself become
emotionally involved in business.

818
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:57,910
I know.
Kit's always saying to me,

819
00:55:57,952 --> 00:56:00,079
"Don't get emotional
when you turn tricks. "

820
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,999
That's why no kissing.
It's too personal.

821
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:06,002
It's like what you're saying:
You stay numb, you don't get involved.

822
00:56:06,085 --> 00:56:09,338
When I'm with a guy,
I'm like a robot. I just do it.

823
00:56:14,844 --> 00:56:17,763
I mean... except with you.

824
00:56:17,805 --> 00:56:20,349
Oh, of course, not with me.

825
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:25,646
You and I are such similar
creatures, Vivian.

826
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,982
We both screw people
for money.

827
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:36,157
I was sorry to hear
about your dad.

828
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:39,827
- When did he die?
- Last month.

829
00:56:41,662 --> 00:56:43,623
Do you miss him?

830
00:56:43,664 --> 00:56:48,961
I hadn't spoken to him
in fourteen and a half years.

831
00:56:50,838 --> 00:56:53,841
I wasn't there
when he died.

832
00:56:53,925 --> 00:56:56,719
- Do you want to talk about this?
- No.

833
00:56:56,802 --> 00:57:01,182
Well, I tell you what,
'cause I got an idea.

834
00:57:01,224 --> 00:57:06,521
Let's watch old movies all night.
We'll just veg out in front of the TV.

835
00:57:06,562 --> 00:57:11,400
- "Veg out"?
- Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.

836
00:57:14,028 --> 00:57:18,991
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back.
We'll do broccoli tomorrow.

837
00:57:20,451 --> 00:57:24,372
- Where are you going?
- I'm going downstairs for a while.

838
00:57:26,374 --> 00:57:28,584
Did you say
marriage license?

839
00:57:28,668 --> 00:57:31,170
Now, don't change the subject,
just give me the stamp.

840
00:57:31,254 --> 00:57:36,217
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter,
Brian, whatever your name is.

841
00:57:36,259 --> 00:57:38,219
Oh, I love you.

842
00:57:50,439 --> 00:57:54,485
Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse.
The guy that was here,

843
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:58,197
Mr. Lewis, have you seen him
down there anywhere?

844
00:58:37,778 --> 00:58:39,780
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

845
00:58:39,822 --> 00:58:42,867
I didn't know you played.

846
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,869
I only play for strangers.

847
00:58:44,952 --> 00:58:48,706
I was gettin' lonely
upstairs all by myself.

848
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:58,090
Gentlemen, would you mind
leaving us, please?

849
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,970
Thank you.

850
00:59:04,972 --> 00:59:08,059
People always do
what you tell them to do?

851
00:59:39,173 --> 00:59:41,509
I guess so.

852
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:42,487
Wake up. Time to shop.

853
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:49,035
Now, if you have any trouble using
this card, have them call the hotel.

854
01:00:49,118 --> 01:00:51,746
All right?

855
01:00:51,787 --> 01:00:53,873
More shopping.

856
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:56,083
Mm-hmm.

857
01:00:56,167 --> 01:01:00,338
I'm surprised you didn't
buy more than one dress yesterday.

858
01:01:00,421 --> 01:01:04,133
- Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.
- Why not?

859
01:01:04,217 --> 01:01:06,802
They were mean to me.

860
01:01:06,886 --> 01:01:09,263
Mean to you?

861
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,518
People are looking at me.

862
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:16,229
They're not looking at you;
they're looking at me.

863
01:01:16,312 --> 01:01:18,731
The stores are not nice to people.
I don't like it.

864
01:01:18,815 --> 01:01:23,569
Stores are never nice to people;
they're nice to credit cards.

865
01:01:23,653 --> 01:01:27,532
Okay, stop fidgeting.
Get rid of your gum.

866
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:32,203
I don't believe
you did that.

867
01:01:34,372 --> 01:01:38,125
- Yes.
- I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you?

868
01:01:38,209 --> 01:01:40,545
- Edward Lewis.
- Ah, yes, sir.

869
01:01:40,628 --> 01:01:44,173
- You see this young lady over here.
- Yes.

870
01:01:44,257 --> 01:01:48,678
- Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is?
- Oh, yes.

871
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:54,308
Oh, no! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many
things as beautiful as she would want them to be.

872
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:57,186
That's the point I was getting at,
and I think we can all agree with that.

873
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:01,691
- That's why when you came in- - Excuse me.
We're gonna need a few more people helping us.

874
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:06,195
I'll tell you why. We're going to be
spending an obscene amount of money in here.

875
01:02:06,237 --> 01:02:09,157
So we're going to need
a lot more help sucking up to us.

876
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,659
That's what we really like.
You understand that.

877
01:02:11,742 --> 01:02:14,745
Sir, you're in the right store
and the right city for that matter.

878
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:17,957
Anything you see here, we can do,
by the way. Get ready to have some fun.

879
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,668
Mary Pat, Mary Kate,
Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it!

880
01:02:20,751 --> 01:02:23,129
- Come on. Bring it out, girls.
- Oh, this is absolutely divine.

881
01:02:23,212 --> 01:02:25,047
- Excuse me, sir, uh,
- Yeah?

882
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:29,010
exactly how obscene an amount of money
were you talking about?

883
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:31,345
Just profane
or really offensive?

884
01:02:31,429 --> 01:02:35,641
- Really offensive.
- I like him so much!

885
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:54,327
Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it
going so far? Pretty well, I think.

886
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:57,747
I think we need some
major sucking up.

887
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:01,709
Very well, sir. You're not only
handsome, but a powerful man.

888
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:04,545
I could see the second you walked in
here, you were someone to reckon with-

889
01:03:04,629 --> 01:03:06,547
- Hollister.
- Yes, sir.

890
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:08,633
Not me. Her.

891
01:03:08,716 --> 01:03:10,760
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

892
01:03:10,843 --> 01:03:12,762
How we doing, ladies?

893
01:03:12,845 --> 01:03:14,764
Oh, Edward, Edward.
Where the hell are you?

894
01:03:14,847 --> 01:03:17,558
The word's all over the street.
Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal.

895
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,103
He's countering?
God, he is a tough old bird.

896
01:03:21,187 --> 01:03:23,940
He knows the navy contracts are stalled.
Where's he gonna get the money?

897
01:03:24,023 --> 01:03:26,317
I don't know. He, uh- I think
he's throwin' in with the employees.

898
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,736
He still needs someone
to underwrite the paper.

899
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,697
- Find out who it is.
- Yeah, okay. You got it.

900
01:03:31,781 --> 01:03:35,827
You're on your own. I have to go
back to work. You look great!

901
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:38,746
- She has my card.
- And we'll help her use it, sir.

902
01:03:42,124 --> 01:03:45,461

walking down the street

903
01:03:45,545 --> 01:03:49,423

the kind I like to meet

904
01:03:49,507 --> 01:03:52,093


905
01:03:52,134 --> 01:03:56,305

You're not the truth

906
01:03:56,389 --> 01:04:01,602

Mercy

907
01:04:06,149 --> 01:04:08,526
- Edward would love that tie.
- Would you give her the tie?

908
01:04:08,609 --> 01:04:10,570
- The tie?
- Take off the tie. Give her the tie.

909
01:04:10,653 --> 01:04:13,072
- He wants to do this, by the way.
- He would go crazy about this tie.

910
01:04:13,156 --> 01:04:15,074
Who ordered pizza?

911
01:04:15,158 --> 01:04:18,578


912
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:22,248


913
01:04:22,331 --> 01:04:27,795

give your smile to me

914
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:33,634

Yeah, yeah, yeah

915
01:04:33,676 --> 01:04:37,305


916
01:04:37,388 --> 01:04:39,807


917
01:04:39,891 --> 01:04:41,893
- May I help you?
- No, thank you. Hi.

918
01:04:41,976 --> 01:04:43,895
- Hello.
- Do you remember me?

919
01:04:43,978 --> 01:04:47,398
- No, I'm sorry.
- I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.

920
01:04:47,482 --> 01:04:50,151
- Oh.
- You work on commission, right?

921
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:52,153
Uh, yes.

922
01:04:52,195 --> 01:04:54,906
Big mistake. Big. Huge!

923
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:58,326
I have to go shopping now.

924
01:04:58,409 --> 01:05:01,829

don't walk on by

925
01:05:01,913 --> 01:05:05,750

don't make me cry

926
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:08,544


927
01:05:08,628 --> 01:05:13,257


928
01:05:16,594 --> 01:05:18,513
Thank you.

929
01:05:18,596 --> 01:05:23,810


930
01:05:23,893 --> 01:05:25,603
- Mister Lewis.
- Gentlemen.

931
01:05:25,686 --> 01:05:27,814
Fellas, let's finish this up
this afternoon, huh?

932
01:05:27,897 --> 01:05:31,984
Jake, set something up with Blair.
Around 2:00, 2:30 would be good.

933
01:05:32,068 --> 01:05:36,489
You were right about Morse. He mortgaged
everything he owns, right down to his underwear,

934
01:05:36,572 --> 01:05:38,658
to secure a loan from the bank.

935
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:41,494
And it's not just any bank.
Plymouth Trust, huh?

936
01:05:41,577 --> 01:05:44,038
- Hmm.
- So, it goes without saying...

937
01:05:44,121 --> 01:05:46,415
that your business means a lot more
to them than our friend, Mr. Morse.

938
01:05:46,499 --> 01:05:48,918
All you gotta do
is call the bank.

939
01:05:52,421 --> 01:05:54,340
Yeah.

940
01:05:58,219 --> 01:06:02,682
Edward, excuse me for saying this, but
what the hell is wrong with you this week?

941
01:06:02,765 --> 01:06:06,727
Are you givin' Morse a chance
to get away?

942
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:11,274
You know what I used to love
when I was a kid, Phil?

943
01:06:11,315 --> 01:06:14,110
What?

944
01:06:14,193 --> 01:06:16,112
Blocks.

945
01:06:17,697 --> 01:06:19,907
Building blocks.
Erector sets.

946
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:24,412
So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk,
Park Place. Wh-What's the point?

947
01:06:24,453 --> 01:06:28,666
We don't build anything, Phil.
We don't make anything.

948
01:06:28,749 --> 01:06:30,918
We make money, Edward.

949
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,422
We worked for a year on this deal.
It's what you said you wanted.

950
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:36,549
I'm handing it to you.

951
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:40,595
Morse's jugular is exposed.
It's time for the kill.

952
01:06:40,678 --> 01:06:42,763
Let's finish this.

953
01:06:42,847 --> 01:06:44,765
Call the bank!

954
01:07:05,995 --> 01:07:07,914
How was your day, dear?

955
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:13,711
Nice tie.

956
01:07:13,794 --> 01:07:15,755
I got it for you.

957
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:20,801
Well, my mother
was a music teacher...

958
01:07:20,885 --> 01:07:25,515
and married my father, whose
family was extremely wealthy.

959
01:07:25,598 --> 01:07:29,685
Then he divorced my mother
to be with another woman.

960
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:32,104
And he took his money with him.

961
01:07:33,189 --> 01:07:35,608
And then she died.

962
01:07:35,691 --> 01:07:37,693
I was very angry with him.

963
01:07:37,777 --> 01:07:40,738
It cost me $10,000 in therapy
to say that sentence.

964
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:42,740
I was very angry with him.

965
01:07:42,782 --> 01:07:45,326
I do it very well, don't I? I'll say
it again. I was very angry with him.

966
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:49,038
Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis.
I'm very angry with my father.

967
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:53,042
I would've been angry
at the $10,000.

968
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:58,923
My father was president
of the third company I ever took over.

969
01:08:00,341 --> 01:08:04,178
I bought it.
I sold it off piece by piece.

970
01:08:04,262 --> 01:08:08,057
- What'd the shrink say?
- He said I was cured.

971
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:11,561
Well, so you got even.
That must've made you happy.

972
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:21,362
Did I mention my leg
is 44 inches from hip to toe,

973
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:26,951
so, basically, we're talkin'
about 88 inches of therapy...

974
01:08:26,993 --> 01:08:30,454
wrapped around you
for the bargain price of...

975
01:08:30,496 --> 01:08:33,249
$3,000.

976
01:08:33,332 --> 01:08:35,918
Yeah.

977
01:08:37,962 --> 01:08:40,631
Ebersol of the Falcons passes to Kennan.

978
01:08:40,673 --> 01:08:43,217
This is Bill Fricker with Gwen Olsen
giving you play-by-play...

979
01:08:43,301 --> 01:08:45,511
- of this marvelous charity event.
- Watch where you're walking.

980
01:08:45,595 --> 01:08:48,931
If you step in something,
we're not going back in the car.

981
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:53,686
Not too near the tree. I don't like the
ants. Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere?

982
01:08:53,769 --> 01:08:58,191
- What if someone recognizes me?
- Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood Blvd.

983
01:08:58,232 --> 01:09:01,569
- You did.
- Come on. Let go. Let go.

984
01:09:01,652 --> 01:09:04,322
All right. You look great.
You look like a lady.

985
01:09:04,405 --> 01:09:06,365
You're gonna
have a wonderful time.

986
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:11,621
Okay. Don't fidget and smile.

987
01:09:11,704 --> 01:09:14,248
Humboldt's coming around to this side.

988
01:09:14,332 --> 01:09:16,626
Toquenee is on Kennan.
Penalty on that play.

989
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:19,962
This is Gwen and Gretchen,
the infamous Olsen sisters,

990
01:09:20,046 --> 01:09:22,590
who have made marrying well
an art form.

991
01:09:22,673 --> 01:09:24,842
- Edward.
- Be back in just a second. Hold on.

992
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:27,678
So, you're the flavor
of the month. Hmm.

993
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,891
Uh, she's just being testy.
Edward's our most eligible bachelor.

994
01:09:31,974 --> 01:09:33,893
Everybody is
trying to land him.

995
01:09:33,976 --> 01:09:38,898
Well, I'm not trying to land him.
I'm just using him for sex.

996
01:09:38,981 --> 01:09:41,901
Oh, yes.

997
01:09:41,984 --> 01:09:45,530
- Well done.
- Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo!

998
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:50,201
Tell me again
why we're here.

999
01:09:50,243 --> 01:09:52,620
- Business.
- Business mingling?

1000
01:09:52,703 --> 01:09:55,039
Yeah.

1001
01:09:55,081 --> 01:09:57,208
That's
the chukker, ladies and gentlemen.

1002
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,210
Falcons, seven.
Gems, four.

1003
01:09:59,252 --> 01:10:03,464
- Excuse me. Edward! Edward. Over here.
- Phil.

1004
01:10:03,548 --> 01:10:05,466
- Ah, good to see you.
- You too.

1005
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:07,468
I want you to meet
a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

1006
01:10:07,552 --> 01:10:10,471
Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian.
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

1007
01:10:10,555 --> 01:10:13,599
It's always a pleasure meeting
one of Edward's girls.

1008
01:10:13,683 --> 01:10:16,018
Oh, my God!
It's Tate Whitley Wallington.

1009
01:10:16,102 --> 01:10:19,272
Tate! It's me, Elizabeth,
from Workout World.

1010
01:10:20,857 --> 01:10:24,610
Sort of an aerobics queen.
Feel the burns.

1011
01:10:24,694 --> 01:10:27,738
Well, let me get you something to drink.
Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay?

1012
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,408
I'll be right back. Did you notice
Senator Adams is here?

1013
01:10:30,449 --> 01:10:32,451
Mm-hmm. I asked him.

1014
01:10:32,535 --> 01:10:37,081
That is why I have pledged
my eternal love to you. Mmm!

1015
01:10:37,123 --> 01:10:40,710
Real genuine guy.
Who is he?

1016
01:10:40,793 --> 01:10:42,795
He's my lawyer.
He's all right.

1017
01:10:42,879 --> 01:10:44,797
You could freeze ice
on his wife's ass.

1018
01:10:44,881 --> 01:10:46,799
Maybe we'll try that later.

1019
01:10:46,883 --> 01:10:50,428
- Are these people your friends?
- I spend time with them, yeah.

1020
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:54,223
- Well, no wonder.
- No wonder what?

1021
01:10:54,307 --> 01:10:57,268
No wonder why
you came looking for me.

1022
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:00,521
And I do need some help from you
ladies and gentlemen in the audience.

1023
01:11:00,605 --> 01:11:04,442
We need you to help replace some of
the divots out here on the grass.

1024
01:11:04,484 --> 01:11:07,320
- So come on out now.
Come on! Come on, folks.

1025
01:11:07,403 --> 01:11:09,780
You heard her.
The stomping of the divots.

1026
01:11:09,822 --> 01:11:12,492
This is a time-honored tradition,
ladies and gentlemen.

1027
01:11:12,575 --> 01:11:17,538
As old as the game of polo itself.
Kings and queens used to do this.

1028
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:21,459
She's sweet, Edward.

1029
01:11:21,501 --> 01:11:23,753
Wherever did you find her?

1030
01:11:23,836 --> 01:11:26,547
976-BABE.

1031
01:11:29,091 --> 01:11:34,096
Only one word
of advice: Avoid the steaming divot!

1032
01:11:40,436 --> 01:11:43,272
No, it's all part
of the game of polo.

1033
01:11:43,356 --> 01:11:45,733
You get to have your shoes
polished by a member of the club.

1034
01:11:45,817 --> 01:11:47,735
I think I got something in the car
that will buff that up.

1035
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:49,737
Thank you.

1036
01:11:49,821 --> 01:11:54,534
- Vivian, hi. David Morse.
- Excuse me.

1037
01:11:54,617 --> 01:11:56,536
- David.
- How are ya?

1038
01:11:56,619 --> 01:11:59,163
- I'm okay.
- I thought that was you. I like this hat.

1039
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:03,209
- It's new. Yeah?
Yeah. Thanks.


1040
01:12:02,223 --> 01:12:05,560
- Come meet my horse, Vivian.
- Well, Edward's waiting for me.

1041
01:12:05,643 --> 01:12:08,521
- He's right here.
- Okay, I'll- Just for a second, though.

1042
01:12:08,563 --> 01:12:10,481
I didn't know
you were playing today.

1043
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:13,985
Uh, I was asking for directions.
There she was.

1044
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:16,779
Oh, so you just ran into her?
That's great. Jesus.

1045
01:12:16,863 --> 01:12:21,117
So anyway, what does she do?
Does she work?

1046
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,328
- She's in sales.
- Sales? That's terrific. That's good.

1047
01:12:24,412 --> 01:12:26,330
What does she sell?

1048
01:12:27,832 --> 01:12:29,750
Why do you want to know?

1049
01:12:31,419 --> 01:12:34,338
Just hear me out on this.
I've known you a long time.

1050
01:12:34,422 --> 01:12:39,177
I see some differences in you this week,
like the tie, and, uh-

1051
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:41,596
I'm wondering if maybe
this girl isn't the difference,

1052
01:12:41,637 --> 01:12:44,932
especially when I see her
talking to David Morse.

1053
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:51,314
- I introduced them at dinner the other night.
- So what?

1054
01:12:51,397 --> 01:12:54,317
Now they're best friends?
This girl appears out of nowhere.

1055
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,737
Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're
trying to buy. Convenient, don't you think?

1056
01:12:57,778 --> 01:13:00,698
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How do you know that this girl...

1057
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:03,701
hasn't attached herself to you because
she's bringing information back to Morse?

1058
01:13:03,784 --> 01:13:06,078
- This happens! Industrial espionage-
- Phil, Phil, Phil!

1059
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,289
- Phil, listen to me.
- What?

1060
01:13:08,372 --> 01:13:12,376
- She's not a spy. She is a hooker.
- Oh!

1061
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,378
She is a hooker.

1062
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:18,508
I picked her up
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1063
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,510
In your car.

1064
01:13:24,972 --> 01:13:27,099
- Oh, you are-
- Yes, yes.

1065
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:29,310
Oh, man!

1066
01:13:29,393 --> 01:13:32,480
You're the only millionaire
I ever heard of...

1067
01:13:32,563 --> 01:13:36,275
who goes looking for a bargain basement
streetwalker, you know?

1068
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:38,820
- Edward!
- I'm sorry I told you.

1069
01:13:38,861 --> 01:13:42,573
Senator. Senator Adams,
I'm pleased you could make it.

1070
01:13:42,657 --> 01:13:45,076
Thank you. I hope the information
I gave you was helpful.

1071
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:47,537
Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you
for it. There's no change, is there?

1072
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,664
No, it's still bogged down.

1073
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:56,295
- Having a nice time, Vivian?
- Yeah, I'm having a great time.

1074
01:13:56,379 --> 01:13:59,298
Must be quite a change
from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm?

1075
01:14:01,008 --> 01:14:02,969
What?

1076
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:05,012
Yeah, Edward told me.

1077
01:14:05,096 --> 01:14:09,016
But don't worry;
you're secret is safe with me.

1078
01:14:09,058 --> 01:14:13,396
Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could
get together sometime...

1079
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:15,398
after Edward leaves.

1080
01:14:16,858 --> 01:14:19,360
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1081
01:14:20,444 --> 01:14:22,864
We'll just
have to do that, hmm?

1082
01:14:22,947 --> 01:14:24,866
Philip.

1083
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:28,870
Hi, tailgaters.

1084
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:31,205
I'd like to mention a couple
of our silver sponsors:

1085
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:33,833
Jacobs Distributors,
Norrell Saddlery,

1086
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:37,670
and we'd like to give a great big thanks
to our platinum sponsor,

1087
01:14:37,712 --> 01:14:41,549
Edward Lewis Enterprises.

1088
01:14:41,591 --> 01:14:44,427
The ball is in for chukker number four.

1089
01:14:53,102 --> 01:14:55,813
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1090
01:14:55,855 --> 01:15:00,151
Fine. That's good.
Seven "fines" since we left the match.

1091
01:15:00,193 --> 01:15:02,153
Could I have
another word, please?

1092
01:15:02,195 --> 01:15:04,155
Asshole! There's a word.

1093
01:15:05,615 --> 01:15:07,533
I think I liked "fine" better.

1094
01:15:07,617 --> 01:15:11,913
You know what? Just tell me one thing:
Why did you make me get all dressed up?

1095
01:15:11,996 --> 01:15:14,415
Well, for one thing,
the clothing was appropriate.

1096
01:15:14,499 --> 01:15:18,252
No, what I mean is, if you
were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker,

1097
01:15:18,336 --> 01:15:20,922
- why didn't you just let me wear my own
clothes, okay? - I did not- I did not-

1098
01:15:21,005 --> 01:15:23,966
I mean, in my own clothes, when someone
like that guy Stuckey comes up to me,

1099
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,803
I can handle it;
I'm prepared.

1100
01:15:26,886 --> 01:15:31,766
I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with
Stuckey at all for saying or doing that.

1101
01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:34,936
But he is my attorney.
I've known him for ten years.

1102
01:15:35,019 --> 01:15:38,564
He thought you were some kind of
industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.

1103
01:15:38,648 --> 01:15:41,692
Are you my pimp now? You think you
can pass me around to your friends?

1104
01:15:41,776 --> 01:15:45,738
- I'm not some little toy!
- Look, I know you're not my toy. Vivian!

1105
01:15:45,822 --> 01:15:48,658
Vivian, I'm speaking to you.
Come back here!

1106
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:51,369
I hate to point out the obvious,
but you are, in fact, a hooker!

1107
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:54,205
- And you are my employee!
- Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay?

1108
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:57,208
I say who; I say when;
I- I say who-

1109
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,878
I refuse to spend the next three days fighting
with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it.

1110
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,631
That's the end of it!

1111
01:16:03,714 --> 01:16:05,633
I'm sorry I ever met you.

1112
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:09,387
I'm sorry I ever
got into your stupid car!

1113
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:12,557
As if you had so many more
appealing options.

1114
01:16:14,142 --> 01:16:19,105
I've never had anyone
make me feel as cheap as you did today.

1115
01:16:19,147 --> 01:16:22,191
Somehow, I find that
very hard to believe.

1116
01:16:29,615 --> 01:16:31,576
Where are you going?

1117
01:16:31,617 --> 01:16:35,079
I want my money.
I want to get out of here.

1118
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:23,044
Come on!

1119
01:17:35,306 --> 01:17:37,225
I'm sorry.

1120
01:17:38,976 --> 01:17:42,897
I wasn't prepared
to answer questions about us.

1121
01:17:44,982 --> 01:17:48,444
It was stupid and cruel.

1122
01:17:48,528 --> 01:17:50,446
I didn't mean it.

1123
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:53,825
I don't want you to go.

1124
01:17:53,866 --> 01:17:57,787
- Will you stay the week?
- Why?

1125
01:17:59,747 --> 01:18:04,794
I saw you talking to David Morse;
I didn't like it.

1126
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:07,213
We were just talking.

1127
01:18:10,758 --> 01:18:12,760
I didn't like it.

1128
01:18:15,555 --> 01:18:18,099
Down?

1129
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:31,988
You hurt me.

1130
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:35,199
Yes.

1131
01:18:36,826 --> 01:18:39,036
Don't do it again.

1132
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:05,438
First guy I ever loved
was a total nothing.

1133
01:19:05,521 --> 01:19:07,440
Second was worse.

1134
01:19:07,523 --> 01:19:09,442
My mom called me
a bum magnet.

1135
01:19:09,525 --> 01:19:14,197
If there was a bum within a 50-mile
radius, I was completely attracted to him.

1136
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,533
That's how I ended up here.
I followed bum number three.

1137
01:19:17,617 --> 01:19:19,535
Oh.

1138
01:19:19,619 --> 01:19:23,372
So here I was: no money,
no friends, no bum.

1139
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:29,295
And you chose this as your profession?

1140
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:34,091
I worked at a couple
fast food places,

1141
01:19:34,175 --> 01:19:37,261
parked cars at wrestling.

1142
01:19:37,303 --> 01:19:41,224
And I couldn't make the rent.
I was too ashamed to go home.

1143
01:19:41,307 --> 01:19:43,434
That's when I met Kit.

1144
01:19:43,476 --> 01:19:46,437
She was a hooker
and made it sound so great.

1145
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,440
So one day I did it.

1146
01:19:51,275 --> 01:19:53,444
I cried the whole time.

1147
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:58,783
But then I got some regulars
and, you know-

1148
01:19:58,825 --> 01:20:03,287
It's not like anybody plans this;
it's not your childhood dream.

1149
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:09,502
You could be
so much more.

1150
01:20:12,171 --> 01:20:16,134
People put you down enough,
you start to believe it.

1151
01:20:18,094 --> 01:20:23,516
I think you are a very bright,
very special woman.

1152
01:20:24,934 --> 01:20:28,646
The bad stuff
is easier to believe.

1153
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:31,190
You ever notice that?

1154
01:20:40,324 --> 01:20:43,244
- Tell him I'll call him on Monday.
- Yes, sir.

1155
01:20:43,327 --> 01:20:46,247
- Where you going? Did he sign these?
- No, he said he had to leave.

1156
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:49,375
- Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep.
- Don't panic, Philip.

1157
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,919
Morse isn't going anywhere.
I'll be back here in the morning.

1158
01:20:52,003 --> 01:20:54,088
- Did you send the tickets to the hotel? Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1159
01:20:54,172 --> 01:20:56,090
- Where are you going?
- I have a date.

1160
01:20:56,174 --> 01:20:58,092
With the hooker?

1161
01:21:01,971 --> 01:21:03,890
Be careful, Philip.

1162
01:21:25,286 --> 01:21:27,205
- Do I look okay?
- Mmm.

1163
01:21:27,288 --> 01:21:29,874
- Mmm?
- Something's missing.

1164
01:21:29,957 --> 01:21:33,961
Well, nothin' else is gonna fit
into this dress. I'll tell ya that.

1165
01:21:34,045 --> 01:21:35,963
Well, maybe
something in this box.

1166
01:21:36,047 --> 01:21:40,009
I don't want you to get too excited.
This is only on loan.

1167
01:21:45,723 --> 01:21:48,017
Oh!

1168
01:21:48,059 --> 01:21:51,521
They really let you borrow this
from the jewelry store?

1169
01:21:51,562 --> 01:21:54,232
I'm a very good customer.

1170
01:21:54,315 --> 01:21:56,567
If you were gonna buy this,
how much would it cost?

1171
01:21:56,651 --> 01:21:59,362
Quarter of a million.

1172
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:01,405
A quarter
of a million dollars?

1173
01:22:07,078 --> 01:22:09,413
So, where we goin'?

1174
01:22:09,455 --> 01:22:11,415
It's a surprise.

1175
01:22:13,793 --> 01:22:18,256
If I forget to tell you later,
I had a really good time tonight.

1176
01:22:18,297 --> 01:22:20,049
Thank you.

1177
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:42,488
When you're not fidgeting,
you look very beautiful...

1178
01:22:42,572 --> 01:22:44,448
and very tall.

1179
01:22:44,532 --> 01:22:48,828

coming true

1180
01:22:48,911 --> 01:22:51,831


1181
01:22:51,914 --> 01:22:54,458


1182
01:22:56,586 --> 01:22:59,630


1183
01:22:59,714 --> 01:23:04,719


1184
01:23:04,802 --> 01:23:08,431
-
- You don't want to go to San Francisco in a limousine?

1185
01:23:08,514 --> 01:23:12,477
-
- I've never been on a plane before.

1186
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:16,105


1187
01:23:16,147 --> 01:23:19,609


1188
01:23:21,444 --> 01:23:23,946


1189
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:27,492


1190
01:23:27,575 --> 01:23:29,869
Well, it should
be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis.

1191
01:23:29,952 --> 01:23:31,954
The weather is clear
all the way up to San Francisco.

1192
01:23:32,038 --> 01:23:34,999
We should be there
in about 50 minutes.

1193
01:23:46,177 --> 01:23:49,305
- We're late.
- No, it's all right.

1194
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:53,518
- Opening night never starts on time.
- Okay.

1195
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:55,520
- Program, sir.
- Thank you.

1196
01:23:59,148 --> 01:24:01,067
How nice to meet you.

1197
01:24:04,695 --> 01:24:07,114
Right this way,
Mr. Lewis, sir.

1198
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:14,455
- Doris, how nice to see you.
- How are you?

1199
01:24:14,539 --> 01:24:16,874
- Sir. Wonderful news. Congratulations.
- Good evening, Edward.

1200
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:19,210
- Hey, come here. You gotta look at this.
- It's all right.

1201
01:24:19,293 --> 01:24:24,006
- I've already seen it.
- If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here?

1202
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:26,425
Because they're the best.

1203
01:24:26,509 --> 01:24:28,678
- Is there anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

1204
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,557
- The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.
- Oh!

1205
01:24:32,598 --> 01:24:36,060
- So, you said this is in Italian.
- Uh-huh.

1206
01:24:36,144 --> 01:24:39,272
So how am I gonna know what
they're singin'? These are broken.

1207
01:24:39,355 --> 01:24:42,859
- Mine are broken.
- No, no. That's okay It's all right.

1208
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,862
- Oh.
- You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.

1209
01:24:45,903 --> 01:24:47,864
The music's very powerful.

1210
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:53,077
There's a band!

1211
01:24:55,246 --> 01:24:59,333
People's reactions to opera the first
time they see it is very dramatic.

1212
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:02,253
They either love it
or they hate it.

1213
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:05,256
If they love it,
they will always love it.

1214
01:25:05,339 --> 01:25:08,259
If they don't,
they may learn to appreciate it,

1215
01:25:08,342 --> 01:25:12,430
but it will never
become part of their soul.

1216
01:25:12,513 --> 01:25:15,433
- Mmm.
-

1217
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:12,675
- Did you enjoy the opera, dear?
- Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.

1218
01:27:12,758 --> 01:27:14,760
What?

1219
01:27:14,844 --> 01:27:18,764
She said she liked it better
than Pirates of Penzance.

1220
01:27:18,848 --> 01:27:20,766
- Oh!
- Yes.

1221
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:22,768
Good-bye now.

1222
01:27:28,608 --> 01:27:30,693
- No, don't touch-
- I moved the queen. I like the queen.

1223
01:27:30,735 --> 01:27:32,904
You can't move the queen.

1224
01:27:33,029 --> 01:27:34,822
Did you really do that?

1225
01:27:36,908 --> 01:27:41,746
Why don't we finish this tomorrow?
It's really late, and I have to work.

1226
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:46,167
Why don't you not go to work tomorrow.
Take the day off.

1227
01:27:46,209 --> 01:27:49,086
- Me, not work?
- Yeah.

1228
01:27:52,548 --> 01:27:54,509
I do own the company.

1229
01:28:06,521 --> 01:28:10,191
Here are the storage reports you wanted,
and Mr. Lewis called.

1230
01:28:10,233 --> 01:28:14,362
- What'd he say?
- He said he's taking the day off.

1231
01:28:14,403 --> 01:28:17,240
- He's taking the day off?
- That's what he said.

1232
01:28:20,034 --> 01:28:24,622
I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor
over there. Do you have any money?

1233
01:28:24,705 --> 01:28:27,041
I have money. I don't know what
a snap dog is, but I have money.

1234
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:30,795
Well, I'm gonna give, um
- you'll buy a snap dog; we'll cop a squat under a tree somewhere.

1235
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:32,797
- Cop a what?
- Cop a squat.

1236
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,800
All right,
read the first two pages.

1237
01:28:35,883 --> 01:28:37,677
Okay.

1238
01:28:38,761 --> 01:28:40,680
Mmm.

1239
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:45,351
I was talking to someone.

1240
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:26,230
He sleeps.

1241
01:31:56,672 --> 01:31:58,632
I love you.

1242
01:32:09,726 --> 01:32:12,646
What are you thinkin' about
sittin' here all by yourself?

1243
01:32:12,729 --> 01:32:17,734
The fact that this will be our last night
together, and you'll finally be rid of me.

1244
01:32:17,818 --> 01:32:21,363
Well, you've been pretty tough to take.

1245
01:32:21,446 --> 01:32:24,867
My business is almost over,
so I'll be going back to New York.

1246
01:32:29,037 --> 01:32:31,623
I'd really like
to see you again.

1247
01:32:31,665 --> 01:32:34,042
- You would?
- Yes.

1248
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:38,797
Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you
to have an apartment, to have a car,

1249
01:32:38,839 --> 01:32:43,343
a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck
up to you anytime you want to go shopping.

1250
01:32:43,427 --> 01:32:47,848
- Everything's done.
- What else?

1251
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:50,809
You gonna leave some money by the bed
when you pass through town?

1252
01:32:51,894 --> 01:32:54,229
Vivian, it really
wouldn't be like that.

1253
01:32:54,313 --> 01:32:56,607
How would it be?

1254
01:32:56,690 --> 01:33:02,029
- Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets.
- That's just geography.

1255
01:33:11,705 --> 01:33:15,626
Vivian, what is it you want?

1256
01:33:17,711 --> 01:33:20,547
What do you see
happening between us?

1257
01:33:20,589 --> 01:33:22,883
I don't know.

1258
01:33:26,512 --> 01:33:29,515
When I was a little girl,

1259
01:33:29,598 --> 01:33:34,895
my mama used to lock me in the attic
when I was bad, which was pretty often.

1260
01:33:34,937 --> 01:33:39,107
And I would- I would
pretend I was a princess...

1261
01:33:39,191 --> 01:33:41,819
trapped in a tower
by a wicked queen.

1262
01:33:41,902 --> 01:33:46,323
And then suddenly
this knight...

1263
01:33:46,406 --> 01:33:52,079
on a white horse with these colors flying
would come charging up and draw his sword.

1264
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,373
And I would wave.

1265
01:33:54,414 --> 01:33:58,544
And he would climb up the tower
and rescue me.

1266
01:34:02,297 --> 01:34:04,299
But never in all the time...

1267
01:34:04,383 --> 01:34:09,263
that I had this dream
did the knight say to me,

1268
01:34:09,304 --> 01:34:12,724
"Come on, baby, I'll put you up
in a great condo. "

1269
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,318
- Yes.
- I had to call.

1270
01:34:23,402 --> 01:34:25,821
I just got off the phone
with James Morse. Get this.

1271
01:34:25,904 --> 01:34:28,323
- He wants to meet with you today.
- What about?

1272
01:34:28,407 --> 01:34:31,994
He wouldn't say. Edward, I think we
got him. His nuts are on the block.

1273
01:34:32,077 --> 01:34:33,996
We got him!

1274
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:37,791
Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get
him to commit his stocks to us this afternoon.

1275
01:34:37,875 --> 01:34:41,003
No, it's no good. If he's really caving in,
I don't want to wait 'til this afternoon.

1276
01:34:41,086 --> 01:34:44,006
Have Morse meet me downtown
this morning. Good-bye.

1277
01:34:51,972 --> 01:34:54,808
I have to go now,

1278
01:34:54,892 --> 01:34:58,687
but I want you to understand...

1279
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:00,689
I heard everything you said.

1280
01:35:02,149 --> 01:35:05,319
This is all
I'm capable of right now.

1281
01:35:05,402 --> 01:35:07,321
It's a very big step for me.

1282
01:35:09,072 --> 01:35:13,494
I know. It's a really good offer
for a girl like me.

1283
01:35:15,704 --> 01:35:18,165
I've never treated you
like a prostitute.

1284
01:35:24,838 --> 01:35:26,757
You just did.

1285
01:35:28,842 --> 01:35:32,304
It's Barnard Thompson here,
Miss Vivian.

1286
01:35:32,346 --> 01:35:36,225
Could you come down to the front desk?
There's someone here who wants to speak to you.

1287
01:35:36,308 --> 01:35:38,811
- She says her name is Miss De Luca-
- Let me talk to her.

1288
01:35:38,894 --> 01:35:42,189
Let me-
Let me just talk to her.

1289
01:35:42,272 --> 01:35:47,194
Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here?
The sphincter police won't let me through.

1290
01:35:47,236 --> 01:35:49,822
- Okay. She's on her way.
- Fine.

1291
01:35:49,905 --> 01:35:51,865
- Mr. Thompson.
- Yes.

1292
01:35:51,907 --> 01:35:54,701
The window washer
is refusing to come down.

1293
01:35:54,785 --> 01:35:56,870
It's a Saturday.
Wait here, please.

1294
01:35:56,954 --> 01:35:59,373
- Watch her.
- Yes, sir.

1295
01:36:10,843 --> 01:36:15,973
Fifty bucks, Grandpa.
For 75, the wife can watch.

1296
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,645
Listen, I've been calling you.

1297
01:36:21,728 --> 01:36:24,064
Yeah, I know. They told me
at the Banana you were lookin' for me.

1298
01:36:24,106 --> 01:36:26,108
You were supposed to come by Tuesday.
I left the money at the desk.

1299
01:36:26,191 --> 01:36:28,402
- I was hidin' from Carlos.
- Well, if you picked up the money,

1300
01:36:28,443 --> 01:36:32,072
- you wouldn't have to hide.
- I was busy. I had a life. Nino got beat up.

1301
01:36:32,156 --> 01:36:35,701
We had to visit him in the hospital,
Rachel got arrested. It was a mess.

1302
01:36:35,742 --> 01:36:40,038
Anyway, I got the money. Thank you very much
for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.

1303
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,583
You know, he was talkin'
about you last night.

1304
01:36:42,624 --> 01:36:44,585
He would bust somethin'
if he saw you in this outfit.

1305
01:36:44,626 --> 01:36:48,881
I was afraid to hug you up there.
I might wrinkle you!

1306
01:36:48,922 --> 01:36:53,510
- You look really good. No, something in the shade.
- Over there.

1307
01:36:53,594 --> 01:36:56,221
You clean up real nice.

1308
01:36:56,263 --> 01:36:59,641
You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard
lookin' like you do, not that you ever did.

1309
01:36:59,725 --> 01:37:03,228
Well, thanks, but it's easy
to clean up when you got money.

1310
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:06,190
Yeah.

1311
01:37:06,273 --> 01:37:09,902
- So, when does he leave?
- Tomorrow.

1312
01:37:09,943 --> 01:37:13,572
- You get to keep the clothes?
- Yeah.

1313
01:37:13,655 --> 01:37:19,119
Edward asked me
if I wanted to see him again.

1314
01:37:19,161 --> 01:37:23,749
But I think, I think definitely no.
It's just another week, right?

1315
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:26,835
- "Definitely no. "
- Yeah.

1316
01:37:26,919 --> 01:37:29,129
Oh, no.

1317
01:37:29,213 --> 01:37:31,131
What?

1318
01:37:31,215 --> 01:37:34,259
- I know this weepy look on your face.
- Oh, no, you don't!

1319
01:37:34,301 --> 01:37:36,845
- You fell in love with him.
- No. Kit, please. Stop it.

1320
01:37:36,929 --> 01:37:38,847
- You've fallen in love with him?
- Kit!

1321
01:37:38,931 --> 01:37:42,017
- Did you kiss him? On the mouth?
- Uh, yeah, I did.

1322
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,019
- You kissed him on the mouth?
- I did. It was nice.

1323
01:37:44,102 --> 01:37:47,105
You fall in love with him, and you kiss him
on the mouth. Did I not teach you anything?

1324
01:37:47,189 --> 01:37:51,527
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?
I'm- I'm not in love with him.

1325
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,071
I just- I like him.

1326
01:37:54,154 --> 01:37:56,114
You like him?

1327
01:37:56,156 --> 01:37:59,451
- Yeah.
- You definitely like him.

1328
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:03,497
Well, he's not a bum.
He's a rich, classy guy.

1329
01:38:03,539 --> 01:38:06,625
- Who's gonna break my heart, right?
- Oh, no. Come on.

1330
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:09,002
You don't know that.
Hey, he asked you, right?

1331
01:38:09,044 --> 01:38:12,339
Maybe you guys could, like, um,
you know, get a house together.

1332
01:38:12,381 --> 01:38:14,466
Like, buy some diamonds
and a horse. I don't know.

1333
01:38:14,508 --> 01:38:17,553
Anyway, it could work.
It happens.

1334
01:38:19,513 --> 01:38:21,640
When does it happen, Kit?

1335
01:38:21,682 --> 01:38:23,642
When does it really happen?
Who does it really work out for?

1336
01:38:23,684 --> 01:38:25,936
Did it work out for Skinny Marie
or Rachel? No!

1337
01:38:26,019 --> 01:38:28,355
Those were very specific cases
of crackheads.

1338
01:38:28,438 --> 01:38:30,691
I just wanna know
who it works out for.

1339
01:38:30,732 --> 01:38:33,694
You give me one example of somebody that
we know that it happened for.

1340
01:38:33,735 --> 01:38:35,696
- Name someone?
- Yeah, one person that it worked out for.

1341
01:38:35,737 --> 01:38:38,699
- You want me to give you a name or something.
- Yeah.

1342
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:41,201
Oh, God, the pressure
of a name.

1343
01:38:44,121 --> 01:38:46,206
Cinder-fuckin'- rella.

1344
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:55,618
Mr. Morse, you said this morning
you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis.

1345
01:38:55,701 --> 01:38:57,995
Mr. Lewis is now listening.

1346
01:38:58,078 --> 01:39:03,459
I've reconsidered my position
on your acquisition offer...

1347
01:39:03,542 --> 01:39:05,461
on one condition.

1348
01:39:05,544 --> 01:39:10,549
I'm not so concerned about me,
but the people who are working for me.

1349
01:39:10,633 --> 01:39:12,593
It's not a problem.
They'll be taken care of.

1350
01:39:12,635 --> 01:39:15,805
Well, then, gentlemen. If we could address
ourselves to the contracts in front of you.

1351
01:39:15,888 --> 01:39:19,141
- If you look at-
- Excuse me, Phil.

1352
01:39:19,225 --> 01:39:24,104
Gentlemen,
I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.

1353
01:39:24,188 --> 01:39:26,065
Thank you.

1354
01:39:28,067 --> 01:39:30,778
All right, gentlemen, you heard
the man. Please wait outside.

1355
01:39:32,655 --> 01:39:34,907
You too, Phil.

1356
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:37,827
What do you mean?

1357
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:40,412
I mean I would like to speak
to Mr. Morse alone.

1358
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:46,961
- Why does he get to stay?
- Please, please.

1359
01:39:50,631 --> 01:39:53,926
- I'll be right outside.
- Good.

1360
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:12,695
- Is that better?
- It's all right.

1361
01:40:12,778 --> 01:40:16,532
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Black.

1362
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:21,996
Mr. Morse,

1363
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:24,623
my interests in your company
have changed.

1364
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:29,503
What is it you're after now,
Mr. Lewis?

1365
01:40:29,587 --> 01:40:32,715
Well, I no longer wish to buy
your company and take it apart.

1366
01:40:32,798 --> 01:40:35,634
But I don't want anyone
else to, either.

1367
01:40:35,676 --> 01:40:39,930
And it is still
extremely vulnerable.

1368
01:40:40,014 --> 01:40:45,269
So I find myself...
in unfamiliar territory.

1369
01:40:45,352 --> 01:40:47,271
I wanna help you.

1370
01:40:47,354 --> 01:40:50,191
Why?

1371
01:40:58,574 --> 01:41:02,661
Mr. Morse, I think we can do something
very special with your company.

1372
01:41:02,745 --> 01:41:05,414
What about our Navy contracts?

1373
01:41:05,498 --> 01:41:10,377
Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed.
I... bluffed a little bit.

1374
01:41:10,461 --> 01:41:12,505
- You're very good at it.
- Thank you very much.

1375
01:41:12,546 --> 01:41:16,175
It's my job.

1376
01:41:16,217 --> 01:41:18,928
I think we can leave the details
up to the others.

1377
01:41:19,011 --> 01:41:22,765
I find this hard to say
without sounding condescending, but...

1378
01:41:22,848 --> 01:41:26,560
I'm proud of you.

1379
01:41:27,853 --> 01:41:29,772
Thank you.

1380
01:41:31,941 --> 01:41:34,985
I think we can let in
the other suits now.

1381
01:41:36,487 --> 01:41:40,699
Let's continue the meeting.

1382
01:41:40,741 --> 01:41:43,035
Come in, gentlemen.
Sit down.

1383
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:46,288
Edward, please,
what was this all about? Hmm?

1384
01:41:46,372 --> 01:41:49,500
It's all yours, Phil.
Finish it up.

1385
01:41:52,378 --> 01:41:54,964
Hold it. Hold it.
These aren't signed!

1386
01:41:55,047 --> 01:41:58,717
These aren't signed! Could someone please
tell me what the fuck is going on here?

1387
01:41:58,759 --> 01:42:02,304
Mr. Lewis and I are going
to build ships together.

1388
01:42:02,388 --> 01:42:05,057
Great big ships.

1389
01:42:07,309 --> 01:42:09,270
You know, I think I'm gonna
go for a walk.

1390
01:42:09,311 --> 01:42:12,398
- Just stay here for a while. I'll be back.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis.

1391
01:42:34,628 --> 01:42:39,341
Well, well. Hello again.
I'm looking for Edward.

1392
01:42:39,425 --> 01:42:42,136
Edward's not here.
I thought he was with you.

1393
01:42:42,219 --> 01:42:47,016
No. Uh, Edward is definitely
not with me.

1394
01:42:49,101 --> 01:42:52,980
No, if Edward were with me-

1395
01:42:53,063 --> 01:42:57,776
When. Actually, when...
Edward was with me,

1396
01:42:57,860 --> 01:43:01,322
he didn't blow off
billion dollar deals!

1397
01:43:01,363 --> 01:43:06,076
I think that, uh, Edward's with you.
That's what I think.

1398
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:09,288
- Mind if I have a drink?
- No.

1399
01:43:09,330 --> 01:43:11,290
No, thank you.

1400
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,628
Well, I'll just wait.

1401
01:43:15,711 --> 01:43:19,799
Uh, Edward will be back soon.
Any minute, he'll be home.

1402
01:43:22,468 --> 01:43:25,513
You know,

1403
01:43:25,596 --> 01:43:27,932
this is not home.

1404
01:43:28,015 --> 01:43:30,810
This is, uh,
a hotel room.

1405
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:33,729
And, uh, you are not...

1406
01:43:33,813 --> 01:43:37,274
the little woman.

1407
01:43:37,358 --> 01:43:40,319
You're a hooker.

1408
01:43:40,402 --> 01:43:43,364
Maybe you're a very good
hooker, you know?

1409
01:43:43,405 --> 01:43:47,243
Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care
about losing millions of dollars.

1410
01:43:47,326 --> 01:43:49,912
Because I have to be
very honest with you.

1411
01:43:49,995 --> 01:43:52,873
Right now, Vivian, right now
I really do care. I really do.

1412
01:43:52,915 --> 01:43:57,002
And right now
I am really pissed, you know?

1413
01:43:57,044 --> 01:44:00,047
Right now I am
just freaking out.

1414
01:44:01,507 --> 01:44:03,717
So maybe if I
screw you, huh,

1415
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:06,387
and take you to the opera, then I could
be a happy guy, just like Edward.

1416
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:10,099
- Hey, get off me!
- Hey, hey! Goddamn it!

1417
01:44:10,182 --> 01:44:12,810
- Ow!
- Ow!

1418
01:44:12,893 --> 01:44:15,729
- Come on! Come on! I'll pay for it.
- Get off me!

1419
01:44:15,813 --> 01:44:17,815
- How much is it? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks?
- Get off me! Get off me!

1420
01:44:17,898 --> 01:44:20,693
- Fifty? You a $50 whore, Vivian?
- What are you doing?

1421
01:44:20,734 --> 01:44:24,029
- Get off!
- Stop. I don't want to hurt you! Stop it!

1422
01:44:24,071 --> 01:44:26,115
You already did,
Edward!

1423
01:44:26,198 --> 01:44:28,659
- Out. Out of here.
- All right, all right.

1424
01:44:28,742 --> 01:44:32,621
Look, she's a whore, man.
She's a goddamn- Aah!

1425
01:44:35,082 --> 01:44:38,419
- Aah! Damn.
- Shit. Goddamn!

1426
01:44:39,879 --> 01:44:42,047
- I think you broke my nose.
- Get outta here.

1427
01:44:42,089 --> 01:44:45,384
What is wrong with you? Come on,
Edward! I gave you ten years!

1428
01:44:45,468 --> 01:44:49,555
- I devoted my whole life to you!
- That's bullshit.

1429
01:44:49,597 --> 01:44:52,808
This is such bullshit!
It's the kill you love, not me!

1430
01:44:52,892 --> 01:44:56,061
I made you a very rich man
doing exactly what you loved.

1431
01:44:56,145 --> 01:44:58,105
Now get outta here!

1432
01:44:59,523 --> 01:45:01,442
Get out!

1433
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:14,121
Why do guys always know how to hit
a woman right across the cheek?

1434
01:45:14,205 --> 01:45:17,917
Wham! And it feels like
your eye is gonna explode.

1435
01:45:17,958 --> 01:45:21,629
What do they do? Do they pull you aside
in high school and show you how to do this?

1436
01:45:21,712 --> 01:45:23,631
Is that- Ow.

1437
01:45:27,384 --> 01:45:29,303
Not all guys hit.

1438
01:45:32,181 --> 01:45:35,142
I heard about
what you did with Morse.

1439
01:45:36,685 --> 01:45:40,147
- That was a business decision.
- It was good.

1440
01:45:41,524 --> 01:45:43,943
It felt good.

1441
01:45:46,862 --> 01:45:49,698
I think this is okay.

1442
01:45:49,782 --> 01:45:51,659
I gotta get going.

1443
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,370
Yes, I noticed you're packed.

1444
01:45:54,453 --> 01:45:56,705
Why are you leaving now?

1445
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:02,837
Edward, there'll always be some guy,
even some friend of yours,

1446
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:05,089
thinkin' he can treat me
like Stuckey,

1447
01:46:05,172 --> 01:46:07,716
thinking that it's allowed.

1448
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,971
What are you gonna do?
You gonna beat up everybody?

1449
01:46:12,012 --> 01:46:15,057
That's not why you're leaving.

1450
01:46:16,225 --> 01:46:20,312
Look, you made me
a really nice offer.

1451
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:20,312
Look, you made me
a really nice offer.

1452
01:46:20,396 --> 01:46:23,732
And a few months ago,
no problem.

1453
01:46:23,816 --> 01:46:26,485
But now everything is different,
and you've changed that.

1454
01:46:26,569 --> 01:46:30,364
And you can't change back.

1455
01:46:30,447 --> 01:46:32,366
I want more.

1456
01:46:34,076 --> 01:46:36,537
I know about wanting more.

1457
01:46:36,579 --> 01:46:39,373
I invented the concept.

1458
01:46:39,457 --> 01:46:43,002
The question is how much more.

1459
01:46:44,587 --> 01:46:46,547
I want the fairy tale.

1460
01:46:48,632 --> 01:46:50,551
Impossible relationships.

1461
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:57,641
My special gift is
impossible relationships.

1462
01:47:10,112 --> 01:47:14,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1463
01:47:15,951 --> 01:47:21,499
If you ever need anything- dental
floss, whatever- you give me a call.

1464
01:47:25,544 --> 01:47:27,713
I had a good time.

1465
01:47:27,797 --> 01:47:29,715
Me too.

1466
01:47:40,142 --> 01:47:42,269
Do you want me
to get you a bellboy?

1467
01:47:42,353 --> 01:47:45,397
- No, I got it.
- I'll carry this.

1468
01:47:45,481 --> 01:47:47,441
Thanks.

1469
01:47:54,114 --> 01:47:57,785
Stay. Stay the night with me.

1470
01:47:57,868 --> 01:48:00,996
And not because I'm paying you,
but because you want to.

1471
01:48:06,377 --> 01:48:08,838
I can't.

1472
01:48:15,302 --> 01:48:17,221
Good-bye.

1473
01:48:24,061 --> 01:48:28,065
I think you have
a lot of special gifts.

1474
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:31,068
Mmm.

1475
01:48:40,494 --> 01:48:43,456
- I didn't do it, sir.
- No, no. I didn't say that.

1476
01:48:43,497 --> 01:48:46,876
I want you to call maintenance and have them
deal with this. You must delegate authority.

1477
01:48:46,959 --> 01:48:48,961
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Barney.

1478
01:48:50,254 --> 01:48:53,507
Miss Vivian. Thank you.

1479
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:56,510
I wanted to say good-bye.

1480
01:48:56,552 --> 01:48:59,513
Well, then, I gather you're not
accompanying Mr. Lewis to New York.

1481
01:48:59,597 --> 01:49:04,435
Come on, Barney. You and me live
in the real world... most of the time.

1482
01:49:05,769 --> 01:49:07,688
Have you arranged
for transportation?

1483
01:49:07,771 --> 01:49:09,690
- I'm gonna call a cab.
- Allow me.

1484
01:49:09,773 --> 01:49:12,193
- Darryl.
- Yes, sir.

1485
01:49:12,234 --> 01:49:15,321
Please take Miss Vivian
anywhere she wishes to go.

1486
01:49:15,362 --> 01:49:17,323
Yes, sir.

1487
01:49:23,746 --> 01:49:25,706
It's been a pleasure
knowing you.

1488
01:49:25,748 --> 01:49:28,584
Come and visit us again
sometime.

1489
01:49:30,336 --> 01:49:32,254
Stay cool.

1490
01:49:44,725 --> 01:49:47,686


1491
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:50,856


1492
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:53,984


1493
01:49:54,068 --> 01:49:56,737


1494
01:49:56,821 --> 01:49:59,657


1495
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:02,827


1496
01:50:02,910 --> 01:50:05,746


1497
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:08,958


1498
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:11,752


1499
01:50:11,794 --> 01:50:14,755


1500
01:50:14,839 --> 01:50:18,092


1501
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:22,888


1502
01:50:22,972 --> 01:50:26,183


1503
01:50:26,267 --> 01:50:28,936


1504
01:50:28,978 --> 01:50:31,981


1505
01:50:32,064 --> 01:50:34,859


1506
01:50:34,942 --> 01:50:38,112


1507
01:50:38,195 --> 01:50:40,489


1508
01:50:40,573 --> 01:50:44,076


1509
01:51:01,594 --> 01:51:03,512
Is that everything, sir?

1510
01:51:03,596 --> 01:51:05,598
Yes. Yes, that's everything.

1511
01:51:05,681 --> 01:51:07,975
- I'll meet you downstairs, sir.
- Thank you.

1512
01:51:10,769 --> 01:51:13,397
We look so dopey.

1513
01:51:14,607 --> 01:51:17,818
San Francisco's not
that great, you know.

1514
01:51:17,902 --> 01:51:21,906
It's bad climate. It's foggy.
It's unpredictable.

1515
01:51:21,989 --> 01:51:24,033
I'll wear a sweater.

1516
01:51:24,116 --> 01:51:26,243
What are you gonna do there?

1517
01:51:26,327 --> 01:51:28,871
Get a job.
Finish high school.

1518
01:51:28,954 --> 01:51:32,541
I got things I can do. I used to make
pretty good grades in high school.

1519
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:35,586
Yeah, I could see that about you.
I could see that.

1520
01:51:39,715 --> 01:51:42,259
Sure you won't come with me?

1521
01:51:42,343 --> 01:51:45,012
And leave all this?
Not in a million.

1522
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:48,557
Come here.

1523
01:51:52,978 --> 01:51:55,856
Whoa. Whoa. What is this?

1524
01:51:57,316 --> 01:52:00,528
It's part of the Edward Lewis
scholarship fund.

1525
01:52:00,569 --> 01:52:03,239
We think you got a lot
of potential, Kit De Luca.

1526
01:52:03,322 --> 01:52:08,035
You do? You think
I got potential?

1527
01:52:08,077 --> 01:52:12,248
Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody
tell you different, okay?

1528
01:52:12,331 --> 01:52:14,792
Okay.

1529
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:16,836
Take care of you.

1530
01:52:16,919 --> 01:52:19,463
No, I can't, I can't.
It's your favorite.

1531
01:52:21,507 --> 01:52:24,051
What time's your bus?

1532
01:52:24,135 --> 01:52:26,137
An hour.

1533
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:28,973
Yeah, well, I gotta split,
'cause good-byes make me crazy.

1534
01:52:29,056 --> 01:52:33,227
- So, take care of you.
- Whoa.

1535
01:52:37,022 --> 01:52:38,941
Mr. Lewis.

1536
01:52:39,024 --> 01:52:41,735
You don't have
any messages for me, do you?

1537
01:52:41,819 --> 01:52:44,280
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

1538
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,826
I'll need a car
to the airport also.

1539
01:52:48,909 --> 01:52:51,495
Of course. Darryl will take you
wherever you need to go.

1540
01:52:51,579 --> 01:52:53,789
- Darryl, the limousine out front, please?
- Yes, sir.

1541
01:52:53,873 --> 01:52:56,584
Thank you, Darryl.

1542
01:52:58,169 --> 01:53:00,087
- One last thing. If you could possibly...
- Yes.

1543
01:53:00,171 --> 01:53:03,257
- return this to Fred's for me, please.
- Yes, of course.

1544
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:05,509
May I, sir?

1545
01:53:05,593 --> 01:53:08,095
Of course, please.

1546
01:53:15,394 --> 01:53:18,397
It must be difficult
to let go of something so beautiful.

1547
01:53:20,608 --> 01:53:25,070
You know, Darryl also drove
Miss Vivian home yesterday.

1548
01:53:29,074 --> 01:53:30,993
I'll take care of it.

1549
01:53:32,495 --> 01:53:34,622
Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

1550
01:53:46,509 --> 01:53:49,178
Your plane is leaving
as scheduled, sir,

1551
01:53:49,261 --> 01:53:51,972
and you should be back
in New York on time.

1552
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:05,820
I'm gonna have to charge
you a little more rent than Vivian...

1553
01:54:05,903 --> 01:54:07,822
because I've got this beauty course
I'm looking into.

1554
01:54:07,905 --> 01:54:09,824
I'm not gonna be there
that much, you know?

1555
01:54:09,907 --> 01:54:12,326
'Cause you can't- You just can't
turn tricks forever.

1556
01:54:12,409 --> 01:54:14,745
You gotta have a goal.
Do you have a goal?

1557
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:16,956
Well, I always wanted
to be in the Ice Capades.

1558
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:21,001
- Help you, love?
- There you go. Thank you very much.

1559
01:54:21,085 --> 01:54:23,337
So, you got a lot of stuff
you gotta move in?

1560
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:26,382
No, Carlos burned most of my stuff
when I said I was movin' out.

1561
01:54:53,367 --> 01:54:55,286
Vivian!

1562
01:54:55,369 --> 01:54:57,413
Vivian.

1563
01:55:01,959 --> 01:55:05,796
Princess Vivian!
Come down!

1564
01:55:10,134 --> 01:55:12,636
- Had to be the top floor, right?
- It's the best.

1565
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:15,473
All right.
I'm coming up.

1566
01:55:50,132 --> 01:55:55,262
So what happened after he climbed up
the tower and rescued her?

1567
01:55:55,346 --> 01:55:58,057
She rescues him right back.

1568
01:56:08,859 --> 01:56:12,071
Welcome to Hollywood.
What's your dream?

1569
01:56:12,154 --> 01:56:16,992
Everybody comes here.
This is Hollywood, the land of dreams.

1570
01:56:17,034 --> 01:56:21,330
Some dreams come true, some don't.
But keep on dreamin'.

1571
01:56:21,372 --> 01:56:26,836
This is Hollywood. Always time
to dream, so keep on dreamin'.

1572
01:56:27,002 --> 01:56:28,212


1573
01:56:28,295 --> 01:56:30,297


1574
01:56:30,381 --> 01:56:34,093

The kind I like to meet

1575
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:36,804


1576
01:56:36,887 --> 01:56:40,599

You're not the truth

1577
01:56:40,683 --> 01:56:45,312

as good as you

1578
01:56:47,022 --> 01:56:48,941


1579
01:56:51,944 --> 01:56:55,823

won't you pardon me

1580
01:56:55,865 --> 01:56:59,618

I couldn't help but see

1581
01:56:59,702 --> 01:57:02,329


1582
01:57:02,413 --> 01:57:06,208

as can be

1583
01:57:06,292 --> 01:57:10,129

just like me

1584
01:57:12,173 --> 01:57:17,219


1585
01:57:32,776 --> 01:57:37,198

by surprise

1586
01:57:39,784 --> 01:57:44,997

I've needed for a lifetime

1587
01:57:46,874 --> 01:57:50,503

was cleverly disguised

1588
01:57:53,798 --> 01:57:58,552

in my mind

1589
01:57:58,594 --> 01:58:01,639

how could it be

1590
01:58:01,722 --> 01:58:05,976


1591
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:10,397

what was in your mind

1592
01:58:10,481 --> 01:58:14,026


1593
01:58:14,109 --> 01:58:17,071


1594
01:58:17,154 --> 01:58:20,074


1595
01:58:20,116 --> 01:58:23,869


1596
01:58:23,953 --> 01:58:27,873

that you would take it

1597
01:58:27,957 --> 01:58:33,003


1598
01:58:34,338 --> 01:58:38,425

that we've been through

1599
01:58:38,509 --> 01:58:41,679


1600
01:58:41,762 --> 01:58:46,225


1601
01:58:52,523 --> 01:58:55,317


1602
01:58:58,904 --> 01:59:02,491


1603
01:59:06,662 --> 01:59:09,957


1604
01:59:14,044 --> 01:59:19,633


1605
01:59:19,675 --> 01:59:23,304


1606
01:59:23,387 --> 01:59:27,892

that you would take it
