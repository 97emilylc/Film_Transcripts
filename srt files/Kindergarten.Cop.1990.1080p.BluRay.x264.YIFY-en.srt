1
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,039
Excuse me.

2
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,287
Shithead.

3
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,319
You shouldn't be here.

4
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,799
I know. Ask for at
least $1,000, okay?

5
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,799
I'll get as much
as I can. You hide.

6
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,759
His wife took his kid
and a couple of million,

7
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,759
and we won't get a thousand.

8
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,279
Shut up and stay hidden.

9
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,006
I told him I was coming alone.

10
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
Hey, Mr. Crisp.

11
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,519
How's it going?

12
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,519
You said you had information
about my family.

13
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,768
Yeah, yeah, I do.

14
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,361
Well, let's have it.

15
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,039
Well, it's going to cost you.

16
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,719
Like $1,000?

17
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,046
(SIGHING)

18
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,519
Okay, that's obviously
not my final offer.

19
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,245
750 would be fine.

20
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,199
I mean, more than fine.

21
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,483
Just tell me what you have, Danny,
and I'll take good care of you.

22
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,159
Okay.

23
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,771
That sounds fair.

24
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,928
I was doing a delivery for Corky last week
out of state, and I ran into your ex.

25
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
How'd she look?

26
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,084
She looked great, Mr. Crisp. Yeah.

27
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,206
She changed her hair and stuff, but
she looked like a million dollars.

28
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,766
In fact, she looked
like about $3 million.

29
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,045
Did she see you?

30
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,080
No. I was changing a tire,

31
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,363
and suddenly, there she was across the
street, taking her kid into this school.

32
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,599
My boy?

33
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,759
Looked great.

34
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,530
He looked very healthy.

35
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,479
It's a real nice, healthy
place where they're living.

36
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,364
It snows in winter there.

37
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,930
Danny,

38
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,451
where are they?

39
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,130
At the school where I saw them...

40
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,331
Astoria Elementary School.

41
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,079
That's...

42
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,965
It's in Astoria, Oregon.

43
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,087
All right.

44
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,399
Did you tell anyone else this?

45
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,204
No. No way.

46
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,962
Hey, I'm not stupid, Mr. Crisp.

47

48
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,599

50
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,845

51
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,083
Danny! No!

52
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,085
Danny!

53
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,079
Danny!

54
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,327
Get up!

55
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,524
Don't you die on me!

56
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,879
I didn't kill him.

Was it Crisp?

58
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,799
I don't know.
I didn't see anything.

59
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,519
I was in a box over there...

60
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,719
What are you doing?

61
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,479
Hey, hey, hey!

62
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,719
Stop it! Don't do that!

63
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,999
Don't go anywhere.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,359
Let me go!

65
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,799
No! Let me off of him!

66
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,839
I don't like what you've done.
I really don't like it.

67
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,519
It feels terrible, and
it looks dreadful.

MAN: I'm trying my best.

69
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,479
Maybe your best isn't good enough.

70
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,799
I'm back.

71
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,519
Oh, great. Well, that was fast.

72
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,324
It was easy.

73
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,319
I have some great, exciting,
wonderful news, Mother.

74

I just found out where
they're hiding.

78
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,210
Are you serious?
You really know where he is?

79
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,370
Manicure, Mr. Crisp?

CRISP:
Oh, how could I say no to you?

81
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,639
Tell me.

82
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080
What's happened?

83
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,679
Just let me handle
this myself, Mother.

84
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,439
I know what I'm doing.

85
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,244

Crisp, you're under arrest.

They're up. When will
you leave me alone?

Hey, I'm a police officer.
This is an arrest.

CRISP:
This man's crazy. Look at him.

96
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,839
He'll kill me. You're just
going to stand there?

You can't just walk in here
and put a gun in my face.

Crisp's wife looked like?

No.

Did he ever say what name
she was using in Oregon?

113

He didn't say anything.

you home. I'll even buy you dinner.

I'll even cook you dinner.

ain't jack shit you can do about it!

118

I've been after Crisp for four years, and
she's letting my key witness walk away?

119
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,039

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,245
What the fuck?

168
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,799
(ALL YELLING)

169
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,129
JOHN: All right, party's over.
Everyone go home.

170
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,690
Next time, my place.

171
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,486
So who are you, man?

172
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,161
Shit!

173
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,726
I'm the party-pooper.

174
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,966
Hi, Cindy.

175
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,484
Do you mind if I sit down?

176
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,208
No. Sit down, man.

177
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,239
Oh, it's so nice to see you again.

178
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,920
What are you doing
here, you asshole?

179
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,800
Cindy, I don't like you
using foul language,

180
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,004
not a classy girl like you.

181
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,962
Don't you have
anything better to do?

182
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,890
You don't understand.

183
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,445
I have nothing else to do, and
I have nowhere else to go.

184
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,679
Why are you staring
at me like that?

185
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,639
I like you, Cindy.

186
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,639
I'm going to be around you a lot.

187
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,079
Days, nights, weekends, holidays.

188
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,959
No. No, you can't.

189
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,359
Yes, I can.

190
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,319
I'm going to hang out with you

191
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,648
until the end of time.

192
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,410
MAN:
All right, move it in. Let's go.

193
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,610
Step onto the numbers.

194
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,241
Face front.

195
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,169
Everybody, hands to your side.

196
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,371
That's the creep.

197
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,919
Who?

198
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,521
Number five. That's him.

199
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,771
Good. Very good.

200
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,879
Mr. Crisp, you will be remanded
into custody until your trial.

201
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,889
Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

202
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Shh. Don't say anything. Just take it
easy. I'll take care of it. Trust me.

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,719
(WHISPERING) You know what to do?

204
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,002
I'm your mother, aren't I?

205
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,479
Mind if I talk to my
friend a little bit?

206
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,967
I'm not talking to anybody
without my lawyer.

207
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,726
He's right in here.

208
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,719
You give me the names of your
drug suppliers and distributors,

209
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,606
and I'll tell the judge what a
nice, cooperative killer you are.

210
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,719
You think the jury's
going to convict me

211
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,604
on the testimony of that junkie?

212
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,964
You could be right.

213
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,079
But what about your wife?

214
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,089
You remember her?

215
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,849
All that hard-earned drug
money she stole from you?

216
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,484
How much was it, $3 million?

217
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,041
I bet she would make a
much better witness.

218
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,639
Kimble, you've wasted
years chasing after me,

219
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,199
and what has it gotten you, hmm?

220
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,319
Nothing.

221
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,639
I'll be out in a week,

222
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,684
and you'll still be eating take-out
food in that dump you live in.

223
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,279
Yeah, I know all about you, Kimble.

224
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,324
Without me, you wouldn't
even have a life.

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,439
My old lady left
'cause of the money.

226
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,361
Yours left because she just
couldn't stand the sight of you.

227
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,519
I've never seen anyone
so little eat so much.

228
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,239
Yeah, I know. I'm hypoglycemic.

229
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,488
If I don't eat regularly,
I get a little nuts.

230
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,719
So, where you from?

231
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,319
Austria.

232
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,249
How long you been a cop?

233
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,279
I been a cop for 12 years.

234
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,799
My father was a cop,
my brother was a cop,

235
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,199
my mother was a cop's wife.

236
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,399
And I have no hobbies.

237
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,599
Good news.

238
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,639
You two are booked on the first
flight to Portland tomorrow.

239
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,559
Locate Crisp's wife and
offer her immunity

240
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,683
in exchange for her
testimony against him.

241
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,087
No offense to O'Hallahan,

242
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,759
but this is my case,
and I work alone.

243
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,639
He works alone. Not anymore.

244
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,128
She's going in undercover as a
substitute kindergarten teacher.

245
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,479
Not exactly a job for you.

246
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,599
I used to be a teacher.

247
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,839
We'll be fine.

248
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,199
What do I do?

249
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,679
She locates the kid, you find
the mother and the cash,

250
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,439
and Crisp spends his life
making license plates.

251
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,085
Bon voyage.

252
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,803
Oh, and Kimble, the name's O'Hara.

253
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,279

at 17. Real name's Rachel Myatt.

254

She's from Hannibal,
Missouri, class of '76.

255

in the school orchestra,

256

captain of the girls'
softball team.

257
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,719
Her ambition was "To travel,

258
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,599
"experience life, and
meet interesting people."

259
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,450
Like Crisp.

260
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,531
Okay.

261
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,319
Relax.

262
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,488
Don't let him get to you.

263
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,359
That's her 10 years later.

264
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,239
It's a great shot of an ear.

265
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,959
You get in touch with her parents?

266
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,439
They're both dead.

267
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,405
The only relative she's
got left is the kid.

268
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,164
BOY: Hey.

269
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,279
Okay. This is the only
picture we have of him.

271
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,959
That helps much.

272
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,239
It's the best I could do.

273
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,719
Breakfast, sir? Ma'am?

274
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,959
- Please.
- No. No, no.

275
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,764
That's a first.

276
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,679
Listen, I was just thinking.

277
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,999
Maybe we should take a wild stab
at getting to know each other

278
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,328
before we have to
pretend we're married.

279
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,799
What do you want to know?

280
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,729
How long have we been married?

281
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,199
A long time.

282
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,006
People won't expect us to
talk much to each other.

283

BOY 1:
I want to read it, too. Stop it.

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,599
BOY 2: Please? Let me take a look.

there, this is what I'll do with you.

Ohh.

288
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,199
What's the matter?

289
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,559
I don't know.

290
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,999
I just don't feel so good.

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,519
You hungry?

292
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,290
I got to get out of here right now.

293
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,119
Get those tree stumps out of my
way before I vomit all over them.

Is your wife okay, sir?

296

Compared to what?

297
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,199
PHOEBE: Maybe it was the burrito.
Or it could've been the sausages.

298
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,679
I don't think it was
the crab salad.

299
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,719
It couldn't have been the donuts.

Excuse me.

Oh, I hate feeling like this.

303
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,411
I hate it, too.

00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,199
Uh-oh.

305
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,759
Uh-oh what?

306
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,919
Uh-oh, pull over.

307
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,039
Now?

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,129
Yeah. Please hurry.

You look much better already.

318

Oh. Kindergarten, 6-year-olds.

319
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,839
That's why I quit
teaching, you know.

320
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,799
I got so sick of
other people's kids.

321
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,324
I was afraid that I'd never
want to have any of my own.

I have a son.

He lives with his
mother and stepfather.

better than you.

495
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,806
Is she?

496
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,884
Is she really?

497
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,207
My mom's a teacher in this school,

498
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,839
and she's a lot
better than you, too.

499
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,087
Great.

500
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,519
On Monday nights, my mom tutors
and Mrs. Quinn takes care of me.

501
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,484
She's better than you, too.

502
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,081
Great.

503
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,483
And Frankie, my swimming teacher,

504
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,407
and Gus, my T-ball coach,
are better than you, too.

505
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,168
I really appreciate your honesty.

506
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,927
You happen to know someone
that's not better than me?

507
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,568
I don't know that many people.

508
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,039
John?

509
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,199
(GASPING)

510
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,640
Are you there?

511
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,090
How did it go?

512
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,606
Go away.

513
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,763
It went that well, huh?

514
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,123
You take over tomorrow.

515
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,443
And blow our cover?

516
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,446
Can't do it.

517
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,645
They're horrible.

518
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,290
Tell me about it.

519
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,364
WOMAN: He's gay. What kind of a man
teaches kindergarten? He's obviously gay.

520
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,370
A male kindergarten teacher
isn't what I'm used to.

521
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,768
Samantha calls him "The Giant."

522
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,519
There he is.

523
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,801
Where, honey?

524
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,039
Holy cow, is that your new teacher?

525
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,119
Yeah.

526
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,845
Oh, my God.

527
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,279
What are you doing?

528
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,079
- I'm not wearing makeup.
- None of us are.

529
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,240
You're married. You're
allowed to look like slobs.

530
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,079
Be good. I'll be
back to pick you up.

531
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,599
CHILDREN: Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

532
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,759
Good morning.

533
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,719
I told you he was big.

534
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,410
Play with the kids, honey.

535
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,799
Hi. I'm Jillian, Sylvester's mom.

536
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,686
Do you have a minute?
I'd like to speak with you.

537
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,839
Sure. Please.

538
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,280
Thank you.

539
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,689
A male kindergarten teacher.
That's unusual.

540
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,479
You're not from
around here, are you?

541
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,559
No. I'm not.

542
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,759
Neither am I.

543
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,007
Huh.

544
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,559
Anyway...

545
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,839
Um...

546
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,679
I have a small problem.

547
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,959
Yes?

548
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,403
You see, Sylvester's father
doesn't live with us anymore

549
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,439
and I've just been
worried about Sylvester.

550
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,039
He's been acting a
little strange lately.

551
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,730
You know, doing odd things.

552
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,401
Like what?

553
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,760
Well, it seems that's he's becoming a
little obsessed with playing with dolls.

554
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,446
You know, it's weird.

555
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,799
I think I can help you with that.

556
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,606
- Really?
- He uses the dolls to look up girls' skirts.

557
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,009
I caught him doing it yesterday.

558
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,839
Oh. Oh, well, that's a relief.

559
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,759
But I'll keep an eye on him, okay?

560
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,485
Thank you.

561
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,248
Does Sylvester ever see his father?

562
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,841
No. No, not since he was two.
His father lives in California.

563
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,279
That is far away.

564
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,719
Mmm-hmm.

565
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,208
Well, if you give me
his name and number,

566
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,764
I could talk to him about taking
more interest in his son.

567
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,327
That's very kind, but
I don't think so.

568
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,121
But it's tough on
Sylvester, don't you think?

569
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,519
No.

570
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,327
No, what's tough on Sylvester is his
father left us for another man.

571
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,726
Are you married, Mr. Kimble?

572
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,931
No, I'm not.

573
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,721
He's not married, Mom!

574
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,079
(SIGHING)

575
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,599
Welcome to Astoria,

576
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,919
the single-parent
capital of America.

577
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,479
Thank you for your time.

578
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,083
ALL:
I pledge allegiance to the flag

579
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,239
of the United States of America,

580
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,924
and to the republic for which it
stands, one nation under God,

581
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,039
indivisible

582
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,847
with liberty and justice for all.

583
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,011
Are these all your lunches?

584
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,004
You mean you eat other
people's lunches?

585
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,606
Stop it!

586
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,119
Now we're going to do
something extremely fun.

587
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,919
We're going to play a game called,

588
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,691
"Who is my daddy and
what does he do?"

589
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,999
Yes?

590
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,599
Is your daddy a fireman?

591
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,239
He's probably big.
Is he a wrestler?

592
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,319
A basketball coach?

593
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,363
No, no.

594
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,079
What's the matter?

595
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,679
I have a headache.

596
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,039
It might be a tumor.

597
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,685
It's not a tumor!

598
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,565
It's not a tumor at all.

599
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,279
(SIGHING)

600
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,328
What I meant was you tell me, who
is your daddy and what does he do?

601
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,160
ALL: Oh.

602
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,759
Get it?

603
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,610
We start right here. You.

604
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,448
My dad repairs cars driven
by women who are pinheads.

605
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,885
My dad doesn't do
anything since the crash.

606
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,451
My dad gives money to people
that doesn't have money,

607
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,883
and then people use that money,

608
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,279
then they give other money back

609
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,848
and they give the same amount
of money back to my dad.

610
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,039
My dad doesn't live
with us anymore.

611
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,925
He lives in New York
and drives a taxi.

612
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,209
My mom hopes he's going
to die real soon.

613
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,491
My dad watches TV all day long.

614
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,846
My dad works on computers,

615
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,931
and he's, um, the
boss of his company,

616
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,407
and, um, he has a
mustache and a beard.

617
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,999
JOHN: Mm-hmm.

618
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,119
Yeah.

619
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,199
(SIGHING)

620
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,519
He doesn't have that
much hair because...

621
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,408
And he... His head is so big
that he can't wear any hats.

622
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,690
My dad's divorced.

623
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,963
My mom's divorced.

624
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,279
My dad, um, is a psychologist,

625
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,931
and he helps people that are hurt or
lost their feelings, and, um, that's it.

626
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,970
BOTH: Our mom says that our
dad is a real sex machine.

627
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,926
Good.

628
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,324
I don't know what my dad does.

629
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,288
I haven't seen him in a long time.

630
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,485
He lives in France.

631
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,689
My dad is a gynecologist, and he
looks at vaginae all day long.

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,482
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

633
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,005
Thank you. Very good.

634
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,999
Okay. Next, uh...

635
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,043
What's his name with
his back to me?

636
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,239
His name's Zach Sullivan.

637
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,599
He doesn't like anyone
to talk to him.

638
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,959
He's a poo-poo head.

639
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,719
He's a poo-poo face.

640

ALL: He's a poo-poo ca-ca.

642
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,679
Poo-poo ca-ca!

643
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,803
Quiet. That's enough.

00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,201
Hey, Zach.

645
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,724
Did your daddy teach you this game?

646
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,246
Come on, Zach. Let's all play
together. It's so much more fun.

What do you mean?

that come to small towns

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,479
are trying to get away from something,
or they're hiding something.

Well, for example,
what brought you here?

Me? Well, there was an opening
for a kindergarten teacher.

735
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,519
Yeah, but what made you become a kindergarten
teacher? I mean, it is a bit unusual.

- You are.

a teacher. My mother was a teacher.

Ja.

follow the footsteps of our parents.

00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,239
So, when I moved to this country,

743
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,479
I taught geography and
physical education in Arizona,

744
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,607
and then I coached basketball at an
all-girls school in Rhode Island, but

745
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,964
none of it made me really happy.

746
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,479

Because by the time they came to me, I felt
there wasn't much I could do with them.

action is in kindergarten.

You're marrying a chef?

I'm marrying a great chef.

986
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,159
That figures.

987
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,479
You mean that, a great chef?

988
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,319
Of course. You're a genius, Henry.

989
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,719
Not just a good chef?

990

Well, nice to meet you.
Congratulations. Happy birthday.

991
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,479
Thanks. You want some of this?

992
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,319
It wasn't overcooked?

993
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,479
You're the best.

994
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,966
It wasn't a little overcooked?
No. Al dente.

Excuse me. I'm John
Kimble, Zach's teacher.

997
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,439
I didn't know he was following me.

998

Hi. I've been leaving
messages on your machine.

999
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,919
I'm sorry. Things have been hectic.

What about now?

Uh...

1002
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,283
Go for a little walk. Your
teacher and I have to talk.

1003
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,040
Uh...

1004
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,444
I know what this is about.

1005
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,007
I suppose you saw the
bruises on Zach's legs?

1006
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,159
My husband has started
counseling about this.

1007
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,964
He's been going for
three weeks now.

1008
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,243
Please don't bring the school system
into it. It will make matters worse.

1009
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,531
He's beating you, too?

(SIGHING)

1011
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,999
If he wasn't going to counseling, I could
see the point of saying something.

1012
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,680
But I'm sure there won't
be any more occurrences.

1013
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,124
You won't say anything, will you?

1014
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,520
Please?

1015
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,689
If he does it again,
I press charges.

Thanks, man.

01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,639
Hi. It took all day, but I found out
Zach Sullivan and his mother...

1026
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,491
- Aren't related to Crisp.
- I just found out.

1027
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,239
Oh. I got a bottle of
wine for your big date...

1028
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,119
It's not a date, I know.

1029

But Joyce shouldn't think that.

1030
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,999
Thanks. I don't think
it's a good idea.

Why not?

Quickest way to slip up
doing undercover work

1033

is doing things you
normally wouldn't do.

01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,919
Wait a minute.

1035

Of course you would. And

Wow. This is quite a place.

1040
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,999
They must be paying you a lot
more than they're paying me.

After the divorce, he said we could stay
here in exchange for keeping the place up.

It shouldn't be a problem.

That's right. But I'm divorced.

Uh, no. After the divorce,
he moved back to France.

What about child
support and alimony?

and I'd like to keep it that way.
