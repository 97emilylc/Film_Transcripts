00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,332
Doc!

3
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,354
Doc! Doc! Doc!

4
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,181
Doc! Doc! “What?

5
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,276
Okay, relax, doc. It's me.
It's me! It's Marty.

6
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,821
No, it can't be.
I just sent you back to the future.

7
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,196
Yeah. No, I know. You did send me
back to the future, but I'm back.

8
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,447
I'm back from the future.

9
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,282
Great Scott!

10
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,115
Buffalo Bob Smith on TV:
Hey, kids, what time is it?

11
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,721
Children: Howdy doody time!

12
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,263
Great Scott!

13
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,812
Children: It's howdy doody time

14
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,565
Bob Smith and howdy do
say howdy do to you

15
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,395
howdy doody time?

16
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:33,163
Date. Sunday, November 13, 1955.7:01 A.M.

17
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,663
Last night's time travel experiment
was apparently a complete success.

18
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,335
Lightning struck the clock tower
at precisely 10:04 P.M.

19
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,255
Sending the necessary 1.21 gigawatts
into the time vehicle,

20
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:47,006
which vanished in a brilliant flash of
light leaving a pair of fire trails behind.

21
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,054
Were transported forward through time
into the year 1985.

22
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:57,262
After that...
After that, I can't recall what happened.

23
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,144
In fact, I don't even remember
how I got home.

24
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,819
Perhaps the gigawatt discharge coupled
with the temporal displacement field

25
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,318
generated by the time vehicle caused
a disruption of my own brain waves

26
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,367
resulting in a condition
of momentary amnesia.

27
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,741
Indeed, I now recall that moments
after the time vehicle disappeared

28
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:14,867
into the future,

29
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,042
I saw a vision of Marty saying
he had come back from the future.

30
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,129
Hey, doc!

31
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,566
Undoubtedly, this was some sort
of residual image...

32
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,625
Doc.

33
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,880
Doc, calm down, okay. Just calm down.
It's me. It's Marty.

34
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,512
No, it can't be you!
I sent you back to the future!

35
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,788
That's right, doc. That's right,

36
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,790
but I came back again.
I came back from the future.

37
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,126
Don't you remember last night?
You fainted. I brought you home.

38
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,732
This can't be happening! You can't be here!

39
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,232
It doesn't make sense for you to be here!
I refuse to even believe that you are here!

40
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:50,862
Doc, I am here, and it does make sense.
Look, I came back to 1955 again with you,

41
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,785
the you from 1985,
'cause we had to get a book from biff!

42
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,739
So once I got the book back,
you, that is the you from 1985,

43
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,644
were in the delorean,
and it got struck by lightning,

44
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,750
and you got sent back to 1885!

45
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,168
Doc: 18857

46
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,382
it's a very interesting story, future boy,

47
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,176
but there's just one little thing
that doesn't make sense.

48
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:15,098
If the me of the future is now in the past,
how could you possibly know about it?

49
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,595
You sent me a letter.

50
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,847
"Dear Marty, if my
calculations are correct,

51
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,182
"you will receive this letter immediately
after you saw the delorean struck by lightning.

52
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,109
"First, let me assure you
that I'm alive and well.

53
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,235
"I've been living happily
these past eight months in the year 1885.

54
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,112
"The lightning bolt that hit the delorean
caused a gigawatt overload

55
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,445
"which scrambled the time circuits,
activated the flux capacitor,

56
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,451
"and sent me back to 1885.

57
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,330
"The overload shorted out the time circuits
and destroyed the flying circuits."

58
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,083
"Unfortunately, the car
will never fly again."

59
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,459
It actually flew?

60
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,792
Yeah, we had a hover conversion done
in the early 21st century.

61
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,798
Incredible!

62
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,972
"I set myself up as a blacksmith as a front

63
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,392
"while I attempted to repair the damage
to the time circuits.

64
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,310
"Unfortunately, this proved impossible,

65
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:06,267
"because suitable replacement parts
will not be invented until 1947."

66
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:11,321
"However, I've gotten quite adept
at shoeing horses and fixing wagons."

67
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,408
1885! Amazing!

68
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,737
I actually end up as a blacksmith
in the old west.

69
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,496
Pretty heavy, huh?

70
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,541
"I have buried the delorean
in the abandoned delgado mine

71
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:28,213
"adjacent to the old boot hill cemetery
as shown on the enclosed map.

72
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:33,384
"Hopefully, it should remain undisturbed
and preserved until you uncover it in 1955.

73
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,756
"Inside, you will find repair instructions.

74
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,927
"My 1955 counterpart..." That's me.

75
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:46,186
"Should have no problem repairing it so
that you can drive it back to the future."

76
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:50,189
"Once you have returned to 1985,
destroy the time machine."

77
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,990
- Destroy it?
- Yeah. Well, it's a long story, doc.

78
00:08:55,076 --> 00:09:00,070
"Do not, I repeat, do not attempt
to come back here to get me.

79
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,741
"I am perfectly happy living in the
fresh air and wide-open spaces.

80
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,327
"And I fear that unnecessary time travel

81
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,131
"only risks further disruption
of the space-time continuum."

82
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,675
"And please take care of Einstein for me."

83
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,337
Einstein?

84
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,846
He's your dog, doc.
Einstein is what you call your dog in 1985.

85
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,805
"I know you will give him a good home.

86
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,893
"Remember to walk him twice a day
and that he only likes canned dog food.

87
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,195
"These are my wishes.
Please respect them and follow them.

88
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:38,651
"And so, Marty, I now say farewell
and wish you godspeed.

89
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,282
"You've been a good, kind,
and loyal friend to me,

90
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,079
"and you made a real difference in my life.

91
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,627
"I will always treasure our relationship
and think on you with fond memories,

92
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,830
"warm feelings,
and a special place in my heart."

93
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,385
"Your friend in time, doc Emmett I. Brown."

94
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,088
"September 1st, 1885."

95
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,982
I never knew I could write
anything so touching.

96
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,768
I know. I know, doc. It's beautiful.

97
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,066
It's all right, copernicus.
Everything is gonna be fine.

98
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,020
I'm sorry, doc.
It's all my fault you're stuck back there.

99
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,696
I never should've let biff get to me.

100
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,650
There are plenty worse places to be
than the old west.

101
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,304
I could have ended up in the dark ages.

102
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,114
They probably would have burned me
at the stake as a heretic or something.

103
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,789
Let's look at the map.

104
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:31,620
All right, according to this, the time
vehicle is sealed off in a side tunnel.

105
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,204
We may have to blast.

106
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,556
Whoa!

107
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,642
I think you woke up the
dead with that blast.

108
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,395
Take this camera.
I want to document everything!

109
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,690
Doc: This reminds me of the time I
attempted to reach the center of the earth.

110
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,321
I'd been reading my favorite author,
Jules verne.

111
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,950
I spent weeks preparing that expedition.
I didn't even get this far.

112
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,577
Of course, I was only 12 at the time.

113
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:14,459
You know, it was the writings of Jules
verne that had a profound effect on my life.

114
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,292
It was when I was 11 that I first read
twenty thousand leagues under the sea.

115
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:23,380
It was then that I realized
that I must devote my life to science.

116
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,931
Doc, check it out. Look at this.

117
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,225
My initials!

118
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,648
Just like in
journey to the center of the earth!

119
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,095
That means the time machine
must be right through this wall!

120
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:03,212
It's been buried in here for
70 years, two months, and 13 days.

121
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,671
Astounding!

122
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,677
Marty: "As you see, the lightning bolt"

123
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,885
"shorted out the time circuit
control microchip."

124
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,228
"The attached..."
- Schematic.

125
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:19,436
"Schematic diagram will allow you
to build a replacement unit"

126
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,864
"with 1955 components, thus restoring
the time machine to perfect working order."

127
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:28,412
Unbelievable that this little piece of junk
could be such a big problem.

128
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,917
No wonder this circuit failed.
It says, "made in Japan."

129
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,171
What do you mean, doc?
All the best stuff is made in Japan.

130
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,667
Unbelievable!

131
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:53,345
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a cowboy.

132
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,939
And now, knowing I'm gonna spend
my future in the past,

133
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,860
it sounds like a wonderful way
to spend my retirement years.

134
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,780
It just occurred to me, Marty,
since I end up in 1885,

135
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,982
perhaps I'm now in the history books.

136
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,942
I wonder.

137
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,121
Could I go to the library and look
myself up in the old newspaper archives?

138
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,645
I don't know, doc. You're the one
that's always saying, you know,

139
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,730
it's not good to know too much
about your own destiny.

140
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,246
You're right, Marty.
I know too much already.

141
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:25,461
Better that I not attempt to uncover
the circumstances of my own future.

142
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,547
Copernicus. Come on, boy!

143
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,386
I'll get him, doc. Copernicus!

144
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,429
Copernicus, come on. Let's go home, boy.

145
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,313
What's wrong?

146
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,734
What's wrong, copernicus? Come on.

147
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,437
Come on, let's go home. Come on. Come on.

148
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,285
Doc! Doc! Come herel

149
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,578
quick!

150
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,951
What's wrong, Marty?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

151
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,162
You're not far off, doc.

152
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,338
Great Scott!

153
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,589
Check this out.

154
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,595
"Died September 7th, 1885."
That's one week after you wrote the letter!

155
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,310
"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara."

156
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,187
Who the hell is Clara?

157
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,060
Marty, please don't stand there!

158
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,687
Oh! Right. Sorry.

159
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,769
I gotta get another picture.

160
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,198
Doc: "Shot in the back
by buford tannen over a matter of $80"?

161
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,027
What kind of a future do you call that?

162
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,534
Marty: "Buford tannen
was a notorious gunman"

163
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,412
"whose short temper
and a tendency to drool

164
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,414
"earned him the nickname mad dog.

165
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,043
"He was quick on the trigger
and bragged that he had killed 12 men"

166
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,919
"not including Indians or chinamen."

167
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,843
- Does it mention me? Am I one of the 12?
- Just a minute.

168
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,716
"However this claim
cannot be substantiated,

169
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,265
"since precise records were not kept
after tannen shot a newspaper editor"

170
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,185
"who printed an unfavorable story
about him in 1884."

171
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,353
- That's why we can't find anything.
- Doc: Look.

172
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,809
William mcfly and family. Your relatives?

173
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:09,023
Marty: My great-grandfather's name
was William. That's him. Good-looking guy.

174
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,409
Mcflys, but no browns.

175
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,766
Well, maybe it was a mistake, doc.
Maybe that grave wasn't yours.

176
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,076
There could've been
another Emmett brown back in 1885.

177
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,167
- No.
- I don't know.

178
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,396
Did you have any relatives here back then?

179
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,411
The browns didn't come
to hill valley until 1908.

180
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,120
And then they were the Von brauns.

181
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,752
My father changed our name
during the first world war.

182
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:27,958
Doc, look.

183
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,255
Great Scott, it's me!

184
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,216
Then it is true, all of it.

185
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,768
It is me who goes back there and gets shot.

186
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,268
It's not gonna happen, doc.

187
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,521
After you fix the time circuits
and put new tires on the delorean,

188
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,069
I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

189
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,450
The clothes fit?

190
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,083
Marty: Yeah, everything except the
boots, doc. They're kind of tight.

191
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,506
I don't know.
Are you sure this stuff is authentic?

192
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,926
Of course. Haven't you ever seen a western?

193
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,883
Yeah, I have, doc.

194
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,841
Clint Eastwood
never wore anything like this.

195
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,812
- Clint who?
- That's right. You haven't heard of him yet.

196
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,730
Marty, you have to wear the boots.

197
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,479
You can't wear those futuristic things
back in 1885.

198
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,450
You shouldn't even be wearing them
here in 1955.

199
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,092
All right, doc. Look, as soon as I get
there, I'll put them on. I promise.

200
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,108
Okay. I think we're about ready.
I put gas in the tank.

201
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,659
Your future clothes are packed.

202
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,489
Just in case,
fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies.

203
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,454
Oh! What about that floating device?

204
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,500
- Hoverboard.
- All right.

205
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,048
You know, doc, it's gonna be a hell of a
long walk back to hill valley from here.

206
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,420
It's still the safest plan.

207
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,219
After all, we can't risk sending you back
into a populated area

208
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,547
or to a spot that's geographically unknown.

209
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:01,009
You don't want to crash into some tree
that once existed in the past.

210
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,560
This was all completely open country,

211
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,264
so you'll have plenty of run out space
when you arrive.

212
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,476
Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

213
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,188
There's a small cave over there which will
be a perfect place to hide the time vehicle.

214
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,025
Well, the new time circuit control tubes
are warmed up.

215
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,787
Time circuits on.

216
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,770
I wrote the letter on September 1st,
so we'll send you back the very next day,

217
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,582
September 2nd. That's a Wednesday.
September 2nd, 1885, 8:00 A.M.

218
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,335
I get shot on Monday the 7th,
so you have five days to locate me.

219
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,758
According to my letter, I'm a blacksmith,
so I probably have a shop somewhere.

220
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,385
All you have to do is
drive the time vehicle

221
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,057
directly toward that screen,
accelerating to 88 miles an hour.

222
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,135
Wait a minute. Doc, if I drive
straight towards the screen,

223
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,720
I'm gonna crash into those Indians.

224
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,182
Marty, you're not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

225
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,646
You'll instantly be transported to 1885,
and those Indians won't even be there.

226
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,730
Right. “Well.

227
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,445
Good luck for both of our sakes.
See you in the future.

228
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,706
- You mean the past.
- Exactly.

229
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,506
Happy trails, Marty!

230
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,551
Ready, Marty?

231
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,724
Ready!

232
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,844
- Set!
- Hi-ho, silver.

233
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,974
Indians!

234
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,098
The cave!

235
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,502
Man: Charge!

236
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,761
Shit! The cavalry!

237
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,227
Damn, I ripped the fuel line.

238
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:10,159
Maggie!
Fetch some water! We got a hurt man here.

239
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:22,046
- Mom! Mom, is that you?
- There, there now.

240
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,465
You've been asleep
for nearly six hours now.

241
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,839
I had this horrible nightmare.

242
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,890
I dreamed... I dreamed I was in a western.

243
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:40,933
I was being chased by all these Indians
and a bear.

244
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,314
Well, you're safe and sound
here now at the mcfly farm.

245
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,854
Mcfly farm?

246
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,611
Well, you're my...
You're my, my...

247
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,489
Who are you?

248
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,200
The name is mcfly. Maggie mcfly.

249
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,787
Mcfly. Maggie?

250
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,378
And that's Mrs. mcfly,
and don't you be forgetting the Mrs.

251
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,676
- And what might your name be, sir?
- Well, it's...

252
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,556
Eastwood.

253
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,469
Clint Eastwood.

254
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,767
Well, you hit your head, Mr. Eastwood.

255
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:24,567
Not too serious, but lucky for you,
Seamus found you when he did.

256
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,439
Seamus.

257
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,986
Me husband.

258
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,867
You'll be excusing me, Mr. Eastwood,
while I tend to William.

259
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,954
William.

260
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,780
Maggie: Oh, that's okay, will. It's okay.

261
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,915
- That's William?
- Aye.

262
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,593
William Sean mcfly, the first of
our family to be born in America.

263
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,923
It's okay, wi.

264
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,599
This here is Mr. Clint
Eastwood here visiting.

265
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,721
He surely likes you, Mr. Eastwood.

266
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,019
Maggie.

267
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,432
I've got supper.

268
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,188
Seamus: I'm not one to pry
into a man's personal affairs,

269
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,693
but exactly how is it that
you came to be way out here

270
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:16,118
without a horse, or boots, or a hat?

271
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:21,620
Well, my car... horse broke down,
and a bear ate my boots,

272
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,575
and I guess I just forgot my hat.

273
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,458
How could you forget a thing like your hat?

274
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,005
Would you like some water? Yeah.

275
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,139
I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Eastwood.

276
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,563
I'll help you find your blacksmith friend.

277
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,018
You can stay the night in the barn,

278
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,276
and tomorrow I'll take you
as far as the railroad tracks.

279
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,652
You can follow them straight on into town.

280
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,324
I'll even give you a hat.

281
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,033
That's great. Thanks.

282
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,959
Seamus: Ah...

283
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,126
That's my William.

284
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,756
Oh.

285
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,259
Yes.

286
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,808
I think you'll find the barn comfortable.

287
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,807
Never had any complaints about it
from the pigs.

288
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,889
- Mmm.
- Maggie: Seamus!

289
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,145
- A word with you.
- Aye.

290
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,231
Will you hold him for a minute?

291
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,307
Are you sure you're not after
bringing a curse on this house

292
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,447
taking him in like that?

293
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,032
He's such a strange young man.

294
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,085
Aye. But I've just got a feeling
about him, Maggie,

295
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:52,381
that looking after him is the right thing
to do. That it's important.

296
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,129
Marty: Hey, buddy.

297
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,335
Look how the baby takes to him.

298
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,048
Little will never takes to strangers.

299
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,054
It's almost as if he's connected to us.

300
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,180
Hey, will.

301
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:09,898
So you're my great-grandfather.
The first mcfly born in America.

302
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,488
And you peed on me.

303
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,875
- Give us some soap.
- Here you go.

304
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,644
Take a look and see
what just breezed in the door.

305
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,066
Why, I didn't know the circus was in town.

306
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,653
Must have got that shirt
off a dead Chinese.

307
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,391
What will it be, stranger?

308
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,599
I'll have ice water.

309
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,354
Ice water?

310
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,404
Water?

311
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,106
You want water, you better go dunk
your head in the horse trough out there.

312
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,363
In here, we pour whiskey.

313
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,752
- Excuse me.
- For what?

314
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,250
I'm trying to find the blacksmith.

315
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,715
Buford: Hey, mcfly!

316
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,512
Thought I done told you never to come in...

317
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,057
You ain't Seamus mcfly.

318
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,107
You look like him, though,
especially with that dog-ugly hat.

319
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,780
You kin to that hay barber?

320
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,653
What's your name, dude?

321
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,029
Marty...

322
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,448
Eastwood.

323
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,371
Clint Eastwood.

324
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:41,788
- What kind of stupid name is that?
- I'd say he's the runt of the litter.

325
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,498
Hey, now, boys, would you take a look-see
at these pearly whites?

326
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,071
Hell, I ain't seen teeth look that straight
that weren't store-bought.

327
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,633
Take a gander at them moccasins.
What kind of skins is them?

328
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:51,804
What's that writing mean?

329
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,884
"Nike"? What is that?
Some sort of injun talk or something?

330
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,769
Bartender, I'm looking
for that no-good, cheating blacksmith.

331
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,068
- You seen him?
- No, sir, Mr. tannen. I have not.

332
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,900
Tannen.

333
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,149
You're "mad dog" tannen.

334
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,327
"Mad dog"?

335
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,749
I hate that name.

336
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,370
I hate it, you hear?

337
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,332
Nobody calls me "mad dog"!

338
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,339
Especially not some duded-up,
egg-sucking gutter trash.

339
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,381
Dance!

340
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,556
Come on!

341
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,725
Come on, runt!
You can dance better than that!

342
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,027
Shit.

343
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,405
Whoo!

344
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,471
You better run, squirrel.

345
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,924
Get him!

346
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:29,982
Whoa!

347
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:25,084
We got ourselves a new courthouse.
High time we had a hanging!

348
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,854
Thug: Look at him swing.

349
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,608
Buford: Yeah, haven't had
a hanging in a long time!

350
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:00,159
It'll shoot the fleas off a dog's back
at 500 yards, tannen,

351
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,238
and it's pointed straight at your head!

352
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,717
- You owe me money, blacksmith.
- How do you figure?

353
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,419
My horse threw a shoe.

354
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,116
And seeing as you was the one
that done the shoeing,

355
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,505
I say that makes you responsible.

356
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,559
Well, since you never paid me for the job,
I say that makes us even.

357
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:28,514
Wrong! See I was on my horse when it
threw the shoe, and I got throwed off!

358
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:33,227
And that caused me to bust a perfectly
good bottle of fine Kentucky red eye.

359
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,155
So the way I figure it, blacksmith,
you owe me $5 for the whiskey

360
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,449
and $75 for the horse!

361
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,408
That's the $80.

362
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,910
Look, if your horse threw a shoe,
bring him back, and I'll reshoe him.

363
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,616
I done shot that horse!

364
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,918
Well, that's your problem, tannen.

365
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,042
Wrong. That's yours.

366
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,796
So from now on, you better be looking
behind you when you walk.

367
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,502
Because one day you're gonna get
a bullet in your back.

368
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,524
Doc!

369
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:15,687
Marty, I gave you explicit instructions
not to come here

370
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,941
but to go directly back to 1985.

371
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,695
I know, doc, but I had to come.

372
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,948
But it's good to see you, Marty.

373
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,229
Marty, you're gonna have to do something
about those clothes.

374
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,245
You walk around town dressed like that,
you're liable to get shot.

375
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Or hanged.

376
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,499
What idiot dressed you in that outfit?

377
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,879
You did.

378
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,964
Doc: "Shot in the back
by buford tannen"

379
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,307
"over a matter of $80,

380
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,639
"September 7"?

381
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,721
That's this Monday!

382
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,306
Now I wish I'd paid him off.

383
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,519
And who's this beloved Clara?
I don't know anyone named Clara.

384
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,401
I don't know, doc.

385
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,653
I thought maybe
she was a girlfriend of yours.

386
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:07,989
Marty, my involvement in such
a social relationship here in 1885

387
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,996
could result in a disruption
of the space-time continuum.

388
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,296
Certainly not after what
we've already been through.

389
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,502
Hubert: Emmett!

390
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,962
- Hello, Emmett.
- Doc: Hubert.

391
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,008
- It's the mayor.
- Excuse me, Emmett.

392
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,765
Do you remember last week
at the town meeting when you volunteered

393
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,312
to meet the new schoolteacher
at the station when she came in?

394
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Oh, yes, quite so.

395
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,899
Well, we just got word
she's coming in tomorrow.

396
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,942
Here are the details for you.

397
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,488
- Thanks for all your help.
- Anytime, Hubert.

398
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,610
Oh! Her name's miss Clayton. Clara Clayton.

399
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,294
Well, doc, now we know who Clara is.

400
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,259
Marty, it's impossible.

401
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,634
The idea that I could fall in love
at first sight is romantic nonsense.

402
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,050
There's no scientific rationale
for that concept.

403
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,136
Come on, doc. It's not science.

404
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,721
You meet the right girl,
it just hits you. It's like lightning.

405
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,397
Marty, please don't say that.

406
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,066
That's the way it was for me and Jennifer.

407
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:22,112
I mean,
we couldn't keep our eyes off each other.

408
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,234
God, Jennifer, damn.
I hope she's all right, doc.

409
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,657
I can't believe
we just left her there on the porch.

410
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,736
Don't worry, Marty. She'll be fine.

411
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,573
When you burned the almanac in 1955,
the normal timeline was restored.

412
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,407
That means once we're back in 1985,

413
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,582
you just have to go over to her house
to wake her up.

414
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,794
Oh, Marty, turn that valve over there
all the way to the right.

415
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,750
Yeah, pull it all the way around.

416
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,335
Okay. Let's go!

417
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,019
- Iced tea?
- No, thanks.

418
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,979
It's a refrigerator.

419
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,783
Well, I guess miss Clayton
will have to find other transportation.

420
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,150
If I never meet the woman, there's no
possibility of a romantic infatuation, right?

421
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,072
- You're the doc, doc.
- All right.

422
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,704
We'll get the delorean
and get ourselves back to the future.

423
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,395
Oh, listen, doc, I tore a hole in
the gas tank when I was landing,

424
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,046
so we're gonna have to patch it up
and get some gas.

425
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,419
You mean we're out of gas?

426
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,218
Yeah, it's no big deal.
We've got Mr. fusion, right?

427
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,139
Mr. fusion powers the time circuits
and the flux capacitor,

428
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,138
but the internal combustion engine
runs on ordinary gasoline.

429
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,969
It always has.

430
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,020
There's not gonna be
a gas station around here

431
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,723
until sometime in the next century.

432
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:45,734
Without gasoline, we can't get
the delorean up to 88 miles per hour.

433
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,694
So what do we do?

434
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,379
- Twenty-four!
- It's no use, Marty!

435
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:08,426
Even the fastest horse in the world
won't run more than 35, 40 miles an hour!

436
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,270
Marty: Bartender said
that's the strongest stuff they got.

437
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,896
Try it, Marty.

438
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,950
Give it more gas!

439
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,465
Damn!

440
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:54,055
It blew the fuel injection manifold.
Strong stuff, all right.

441
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,054
It will take me a month to rebuild it.

442
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,510
A month?

443
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,641
Doc, you're gonna get shot on Monday!

444
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:04,270
I know! I know! I know! I wish...

445
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,070
Wait. I've got it!
We can simply roll it down a steep hill!

446
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,149
Oh! We'd never find
a smooth enough surface. Unless...

447
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,199
Of course! Icel

448
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,494
we'll wait until winter
when the lake freezes over.

449
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,869
Winter? Doc, what are you talking about?
Monday! It's three days away!

450
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:24,248
All right, all right, all right. Just
let's think this thing through logically.

451
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:28,048
We know it won't run under its own power.
We know we can't pull it.

452
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,592
But if we could figure out a way

453
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,842
to push it up to 88 miles an hour.

454
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,298
Huh?

455
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,564
That's it.

456
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:49,520
How fast can she go?
Why, I've had her up to 55 myself.

457
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,111
I heard that fearless frank Fargo
got one of these up to near 70

458
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,988
out past verde junction.

459
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,741
Do you think it's possible
to get it up to 907?

460
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,949
Ninety? Tarnation, son,
who'd ever need to be in such a hurry?

461
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,285
It's just a little bet he
and I have, that's all.

462
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,871
Theoretically speaking, could it be done?

463
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,709
Well, I suppose, if you had a straight
stretch of track with a level grade,

464
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:16,137
and you weren't hauling no cars behind you,
and if you could get the fire hot enough.

465
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:20,183
And I'm talking about hotter than the
blazes of hell and damnation itself.

466
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,539
Then yes, sir, it might be possible
to get her up that fast.

467
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,645
Tell me, when does the next train
come through here?

468
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,142
Monday morning at 8:00.

469
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:30,398
Here. This spur that runs off the main line
three miles out to Clayton ravine.

470
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,447
It's a long stretch of level track
that will still exist in 1985.

471
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,992
This is where we'll push the delorean
with the locomotive.

472
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,617
Funny. This map calls Clayton ravine
shonash ravine.

473
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,825
That must be the old Indian name for it.
It's perfect.

474
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,831
A nice long run that goes
clear across the bridge over the ravine,

475
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,254
you know, over near that
hilldale housing development.

476
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,926
Right, doc, but according to this map,
there is no bridge.

477
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,842
Well, doc, we can scratch that idea.

478
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,453
I mean, we can't wait a year and a half
for this thing to get finished.

479
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,887
Marty, it's perfect.

480
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,095
You're just not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

481
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,959
Right. Right. I have a
real problem with that.

482
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:10,851
Don't you see? The bridge
will exist in 1985.

483
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,810
It's safe and still in use.

484
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,692
Therefore, as long as we get the delorean
up to 88 miles an hour

485
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,489
before we hit the edge of the ravine,

486
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:22,241
we'll instantaneously arrive at a point
in time where the bridge is completed.

487
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:27,871
We'll have track under us
and coast safely across the ravine.

488
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,204
- What about the locomotive?
- It will be a spectacular wreck.

489
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,164
Too bad no one will be around to see it.

490
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,876
Help me! Help!

491
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,336
Great Scott!

492
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,928
Hurry!

493
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,345
Jump!

494
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:36,655
Doc: Whoa.

495
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,650
Whoa.

496
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,068
Oh...

497
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,866
Thank you, sir. You saved my...

498
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,158
Life.

499
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,957
Emmett brown at your service, miss...

500
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,756
Clayton.

501
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,547
Clara Clayton.

502
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,889
Claral

503
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,433
what a beautiful name.

504
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,575
May I help you inside with these?

505
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,373
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.
I can take care of it.

506
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,794
- You've done more than enough already.
- But it's really no trouble.

507
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,248
Doc, she says it's fine,
and we got to get going.

508
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,085
Ma'am, good luck with your school teaching
and everything.

509
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,049
Clara, I'll straighten everything out
with Mr. statler for the buckboard rental.

510
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,474
Don't worry about that.

511
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,597
I feel somewhat responsible
for what happened.

512
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,688
Oh.

513
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:56,350
That would be very gentlemanly of you,
Mr. brown. Emmett.

514
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:03,151
You know, I'm almost glad
that snake spooked those horses.

515
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,154
Otherwise, we might never have met.

516
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,735
I suppose it was destiny.

517
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,453
Well, thank you for everything.

518
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,743
You're quite welcome.

519
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,706
I will see you again, won't I?

520
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,588
Of course. You'll see lots of me. I'm sure.
I have a shop in town.

521
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,546
I'm the local scientist,
blacksmith.

522
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:31,810
Science? What sort of science?
Astronomy? Chemistry?

523
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,728
Actually, I'm a student of all sciences.

524
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,852
Hey, doc, we got to get going.

525
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,902
Oh, yes. Well, excuse us, Clara.

526
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,819
We have to get going.

527
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,491
Toodle-00.

528
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,899
What do you mean,
you're gonna be seeing lots of her, doc?

529
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:02,086
Well, I might see her
again just in passing.

530
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,416
Come on, doc. Did you see the way
she was looking at you?

531
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:09,347
She did have quite a scare, right?

532
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,891
After all, miss Clayton almost ended up
at the bottom of Clayton ravine.

533
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:13,979
Clayton ravine.

534
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:19,141
Holy shit. Hey, doc, Clayton ravine
was named after a teacher.

535
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:24,104
- They say she fell in there 100 years ago.
- 100 years ago! That's this year!

536
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,509
Every kid in school knows that story,

537
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,570
'cause we all have teachers
we'd like to see fall into the ravine.

538
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,117
Great Scott!

539
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,705
Then she was supposed to go over
in that wagon.

540
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,743
Now I may have seriously altered history.

541
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,917
Look, doc, what's the worst
that can happen, huh?

542
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,375
So they don't name the ravine after her.

543
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,864
Let's just get the delorean ready
and get the hell out of here.

544
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:51,346
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

545
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,427
It's caused nothing but disaster.

546
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,310
Doc, doc, this is Marty.

547
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,436
Do you read me? Qver.

548
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,562
Check, Marty.

549
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,019
Great, doc. These things still work.

550
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:10,074
All right, Marty. Once more,
let's go over the entire plan and layout.

551
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,222
I apologize for the crudity of this model,
but I just...

552
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,238
Yeah, I know, doc.
It's not to scale. It's okay, doc.

553
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,825
All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday,

554
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,752
we'll load the delorean
onto the tracks here, on the spur

555
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,171
right by the old abandoned silver mine.

556
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,045
The switch track is where
the spur runs off the main line

557
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:30,628
three miles out to Clayton...
Shonash ravine.

558
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:33,510
The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

559
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,183
We'll stop it here,
uncouple the cars from the tender,

560
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,431
throw the switch track,
and then we'll hijack...

561
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,481
Borrow the locomotive and use it
to push the time machine.

562
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,230
According to my calculations,
we'll reach 88 miles per hour

563
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,357
just before we hit the edge of the ravine,

564
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:51,066
at which point we'll be instantaneously
transported back to 1985

565
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,572
and coast safely
across the completed bridge.

566
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,404
What does this mean? "Point of no return."

567
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,912
That's our fail-safe point. Up until there,
we have still have enough time

568
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,584
to stop the locomotive
before it plunges into the ravine.

569
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,083
But once we pass this windmill,
it's the future or bust.

570
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,803
Here you go, Marty.
Connect that to the positive terminal.

571
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,139
All right, Marty, you all set?
Yeah. Yeah. Go!

572
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,263
Doc: Train pulling out of the station!

573
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,515
Coming up to the switch track!

574
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,188
Stop at the switch track!

575
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,516
Throw the switch!

576
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,023
Pull up to the delorean!

577
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:32,278
Pushing the delorean up
to 88 miles per hour!

578
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:39,746
It couldn't be simpler.

579
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,124
Clara: Emmett?

580
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,799
It's Clara.

581
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,968
Quick, cover the delorean!

582
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,557
- Hello.
- Why, hello.

583
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,764
This is quite a surprise.

584
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,434
Well, I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

585
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:12,067
Oh, no, no, we were just doing
a little model railroading.

586
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,738
Oh.

587
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,239
Emmett, when my bags
were thrown from the wagon,

588
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,195
my telescope was damaged.

589
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,829
And since you mentioned
an interest in science,

590
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,252
I thought you might be able
to repair it for me.

591
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,295
I would pay you, of course.

592
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,672
Oh, no, no, no.
I wouldn't think of charging you for this.

593
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,923
Well, let's have a look at it.

594
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,301
Clara: I think a lens
may be out of alignment,

595
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:45,013
because if you move it this way,
the image turns fuzzy. See?

596
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:50,192
But if you turn it the other way then...

597
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,941
Everything becomes...

598
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,241
Clear.

599
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,161
I could repair it right away
and have it for you tonight.

600
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,959
Oh, tonight is the town festival.

601
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,584
I wouldn't dream of having
you work on my telescope

602
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,460
during such an important occasion.

603
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,668
You are planning on attending, aren't you?

604
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:21,265
- Well, actually, ma'am, I don't think...
- Yes, of course, the festival.

605
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:26,892
Well, in that case, I'll see you
this evening at the festival, Emmett.

606
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,938
- Mr. Eastwood.
- Ma'am.

607
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,441
Thank you for taking care of my telescope.

608
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,443
You're quite welcome.

609
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,824
It's a nice telescope.

610
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,536
Ladies and gentlemen,

611
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:51,041
as mayor of hill valley,
it gives me great pleasure

612
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,294
to dedicate this clock
to the people of hill county!

613
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:59,132
May it stand for all time!

614
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,588
Tell me when, gentlemen.

615
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:05,643
All: Three! Two! One!

616
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,769
Now!

617
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,652
Let the festivities begin!

618
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,788
You know, Marty, in a way, it's fitting
that you and I are here to witness this.

619
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,537
It's too bad I didn't bring my camera.

620
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,375
Ready, gentlemen?

621
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,171
The only problem is
we'll never be able to show it to anybody.

622
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,472
Smile, doc.

623
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,176
Man: Yee-ha!

624
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,540
What great music!

625
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,335
Yeah, it's got a beat,
and you can dance to it.

626
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:16,459
Step right up gentlemen and test
your mettle with the latest products

627
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,589
from colonel Samuel Colt's patent
firearms manufacturing company

628
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,294
of Hartford, Connecticut.

629
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,175
Now, take this model, for example.

630
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:29,010
The new, improved and refined
Colt peacemaker

631
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:34,315
selling to you tonight
for the low, low price of $12.

632
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,415
- Good evening.
- Evening.

633
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,083
You look very nice.

634
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,629
Thank you.

635
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,132
Would you like...

636
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,511
- Would you care to...
- I'd love to.

637
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,936
Young man, how about you?
You want to give it a try?

638
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,123
No, no. No, thanks. Hey, doc, this...

639
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,252
Son!

640
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,638
- Sonny boy!
- The doc can dance?

641
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,104
Son. Son. Son!

642
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:59,604
Hey, I just told you that even a baby
could handle this weapon.

643
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,778
Surely you're not afraid to try something
that a baby could do.

644
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,105
Hey, I'm not afraid of nothing.

645
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,191
Come on, then.
Let's just step up here like a man.

646
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:11,700
Now, then what you do
is you just ease that hammer back there

647
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,496
and squeeze off a round.

648
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,165
No, no, no!

649
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,039
Right on out there and be real smooth.

650
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,166
That's the way you do it.

651
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,840
- Listen, can I try that again?
- Yeah, go ahead.

652
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:43,398
Hey, just tell me one thing.
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

653
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:44,820
7-Eleven.

654
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,866
Buford, you sure that blacksmith
is gonna be at this here shindig?

655
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,789
Sure he's here. Everybody's here tonight.

656
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,209
You gentlemen will have
to check your firearms

657
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,629
if you want to join in on the festivities.

658
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,462
Who's gonna make us, tenderfoot? You?

659
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,042
Strickland: I am.

660
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,799
Buford: Marshal strickland.
I didn't know you was back in town.

661
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:16,806
If you can't read the sign, tannen,
I presume you can read this.

662
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:20,031
Pretty tough hombre when you're pointing
a scatter gun at a man's back.

663
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:23,184
Just like you, tannen,
I take every advantage I can get.

664
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,940
Now you gonna check your iron?

665
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:30,858
I was just joking with your deputy.
Of course, I'm gonna check my iron.

666
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,740
- We all were. Weren't we, boys?
- Thug: Yeah, right.

667
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,905
Deputy: Tannen.

668
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,829
Your knife, too.

669
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,877
Smile, marshal. After all, this is a party.

670
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:55,217
Only party I'll be smiling at is the one
that sees you at the end of a rope.

671
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,595
Have fun!

672
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,629
See, that's how you handle them, son.

673
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:08,111
Never give them an inch
and maintain discipline at all times.

674
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,156
Remember that word, discipline.

675
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,733
I will, pa.

676
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,949
Man: Swing that partner
with a right big swing

677
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,280
over to the side
it's the same old thing

678
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,705
thank you very much.

679
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:24,127
Why, Mr. Eastwood, nice to see you.

680
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,628
I see you got yourself some
respectable clothes, lad, and a fine hat.

681
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,052
Yeah, well, a couple people didn't like
the way the other one looked on me.

682
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,859
Sure, and that one suits you, Mr. Eastwood.

683
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,802
- It's very becoming.
- Oh, thanks.

684
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,844
Hey, "frisbie." Far out.

685
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,980
What was the meaning of that?

686
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,682
- It was right in front of him.
- Aye.

687
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,938
Man:
Swing that partner halfway round

688
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,271
sashay back to the head of the set

689
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,357
all the way up to the head of the set

690
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:56,159
now, bow to the partner
you're through

691
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,998
- hey, that's mine!
- Not anymore.

692
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,918
- Give me that.
- There he is, buford.

693
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,746
- Where?
- There.

694
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,332
Dancing with that piece of calico.

695
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,634
Thug: What are you gonna do, boss?

696
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:19,804
I figure if I bury this muzzle deep enough
in his back, nobody will hear the shot.

697
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,261
Careful, buford.
You ain't got but one bullet with that.

698
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,187
I only need one.

699
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,776
I told you to watch your back, smithy.

700
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,112
Tannen, you're early.

701
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,573
It's a derringer, smithy.
Small but effective.

702
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,330
The last time I used it,
fellow took two whole days to die.

703
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,300
Bled to death inside.
It was real, real painful.

704
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,958
That means you'll be dead
by about supper time Monday.

705
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:55,385
Excuse me. I don't know who you think
you are, but we're dancing.

706
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,633
Well, look at what we have here.

707
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,340
Ain't you gonna introduce me to the lady?
I'd like a dance.

708
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,178
I wouldn't give you the pleasure.
You'll just have to go ahead and shoot.

709
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,513
- All right.
- No, no. Emmett, I'll dance with him.

710
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,476
Boys, keep the blacksmith company
while I get acquainted with the filly!

711
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:20,031
I don't dance very well
when my partner has a gun in his hand.

712
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,659
You'll learn. You'll learn.

713
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,991
You know, smithy, maybe I'll just take
my $80 worth out of her!

714
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,292
Tannen, leave her alone!

715
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,461
Whoo!

716
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:34,466
Yeah, I bet there's something you can do
that's worth $80.

717
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,299
I believe you've underestimated me, mister.

718
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,800
Have I?

719
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,010
Ow!

720
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:50,266
Stop it! Damn you, tannen!

721
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,772
No, I damn you!

722
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,943
I damn you to hell!

723
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,738
You.

724
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,448
Hey, lighten up, jerk!

725
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,538
Mighty strong words, runt!

726
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:16,625
You man enough to back them up
with more than just a pie plate?

727
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,131
Look, just leave my friends alone.

728
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,682
What's wrong, dude? You yellow?

729
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,152
That's what I thought. A yellow belly.

730
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,156
Nobody calls me yellow.

731
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:48,078
Then let's finish it right now.

732
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,910
Not now, buford. Marshal's got our guns.

733
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,086
Like I said, we'll finish this tomorrow!

734
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:56,461
Tomorrow we're robbing the pine city stage.

735
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,042
What about Monday?
We doing anything Monday?

736
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,157
No, Monday would be fine.
You can kill him on Monday.

737
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:05,094
I'll be back this way on Monday.
We'll settle this then.

738
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:09,303
Right there out in the street
in front of the palace saloon.

739
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,981
Yeah, right. When?

740
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,979
- High noon?
- Noon?

741
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,230
I do my killing before breakfast. 7:00!

742
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:26,491
8:00. I do my killing after breakfast.

743
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,991
Doc: Marty!

744
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,815
Strickland: All right, now. Break it up.

745
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,627
What's all this about?
You causing trouble here, tannen?

746
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,457
No trouble, marshal.

747
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,795
Just a little personal matter
between me and Eastwood.

748
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:44,797
This don't concern the law.

749
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,803
Tonight, everything concerns the law.
Now break it up.

750
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:51,307
Any brawling, it's 15
days in the county jail.

751
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:55,687
All right, folks. Come on, this is a party.
Come on! Let's have some fun!

752
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,114
8:00 Monday, runt.

753
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:08,537
If you ain't here, I'll hunt you
and shoot you down like a duck.

754
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,831
It's "dog," buford.
Shoot him down like a dog.

755
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:16,537
Let's go, boys!
Let these sissies have their party!

756
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,214
Marty, what are you doing,
saying you're gonna meet tannen?

757
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:22,338
Hey, doc, doc, don't worry about it.

758
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,841
Monday morning 8:00 A.M.
we're gonna be gone, right?

759
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,889
Theoretically, yes,
but what if the train's late?

760
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,386
Late? We'll discuss this later.

761
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,746
No, we'll discuss it now. Late?
What do you mean?

762
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,307
- Thank you for your gallantry, Mr. Eastwood.
- Hey, ma'am.

763
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,730
Had you not interceded,
Emmett might have been shot.

764
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,559
Marty... Clint, I'm gonna take Clara home.

765
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,841
- Right. Good night, doc. Good night, Clara.
- You sure set him straight, Mr. Eastwood.

766
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,760
I'm glad somebody finally got the gumption
to stand up to that son of a bitch.

767
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,584
You're all right in my book, Mr. Eastwood.
I'd like to buy you a drink.

768
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,723
Hey, listen, I don't want a drink.

769
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,474
- You don't have to buy me anything.
- Young man. Young man.

770
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,518
- It was no big deal.
- I'd like for you to have this brand-new

771
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,625
Colt peacemaker and gun belt
free of charge.

772
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:59,504
- Free?
- I want everybody to know

773
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:03,379
that the gun that shot buford tannen
was a Colt peacemaker!

774
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,212
Hey, no problem. Thanks a lot.

775
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:10,174
Of course you understand that if you lose,
I'm taking it back.

776
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,894
Thanks again.

777
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:21,026
You had him, Mr. Eastwood.
You could have just walked away,

778
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,353
and nobody would have thought
the less of you for it.

779
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:27,612
All it would have been was words,
hot air from a buffoon.

780
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,408
Instead, you let him rile you.

781
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:33,535
Rile you into playing his game,
his way, by his rules.

782
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,957
Seamus, relax. I know what I'm doing.

783
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:38,126
- He reminds me of poor Martin.
- Aye.

784
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,419
- Who?
- Me brother.

785
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:42,623
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You have a brother named Martin mcfly?

786
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,129
Had a brother.

787
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,927
Martin used to let men provoke him
into fighting.

788
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,881
He was concerned that people
would think him a coward if he refused.

789
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,308
That's how he got a bowie knife
shoved through his belly

790
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,262
in a saloon in Virginia city.

791
01:02:56,356 --> 01:03:00,190
Never considered the future, poor Martin.
God rest his soul.

792
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:05,529
Sure, and I hope you're considering
the future, Mr. Eastwood.

793
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,284
I think about it all the time.

794
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,933
Clara: And that crater
in the middle north west,

795
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,018
the one that's out there
all by itself like a starburst...

796
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,077
Doc: Uh-huh.

797
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,409
That one's called copernicus.

798
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,871
Listen to me. I feel like
I'm teaching school.

799
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,462
Please, continue the lesson.

800
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,545
I never found lunar geography
so fascinating.

801
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,755
You're quite knowledgeable.

802
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,638
When I was 11, I had diphtheria.
I was quarantined for three months.

803
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,313
So my father brought this telescope,
and he put it next to my bed

804
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,981
so I could see everything out the window.

805
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:46,395
Emmett, do you think we'll ever be able
to travel to the moon

806
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:49,572
the way we travel across the country
on trains?

807
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,072
Definitely. Although not for 84 years
and not on trains.

808
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:56,997
We'll have space vehicles,
capsules sent aloft with rockets.

809
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:01,417
Devices that create giant explosions.
Explosions so powerful that they just...

810
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,620
That they break the pull
of the earth's gravity

811
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:06,923
and send the projectile
through outer space.

812
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,718
Emmett, I read that book, too!

813
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:14,343
You're quoting Jules verne
from the earth to the moon.

814
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,720
You've read Jules verne?

815
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:19,390
I adore Jules verne.

816
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:21,096
So dol.

817
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:24,058
Twenty thousand leagues under the sea.
My absolute favorite.

818
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:26,130
The first time I read that
when I was a little boy,

819
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,736
why, I wanted to meet captain Nemo.

820
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,986
Don't tease, Emmett. You couldn't have
read that when you were a boy.

821
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,443
It was only first published 10 years ago.

822
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,656
Oh, yes. Well, I meant it made me
feel like a boy.

823
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:45,496
I never met a woman
who liked Jules verne before.

824
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,963
I never ever met a man like you before.

825
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,766
Doc?

826
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,352
Doc?

827
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,732
Hope you know what you're doing.

828
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,838
You talking to me?

829
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,797
You talking to me, tannen?

830
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,266
Well, I'm the only one here.

831
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:26,016
Go ahead, make my day.

832
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,356
- Say good morning, Mr. Eastwood.
- Morning.

833
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,065
Have a cigar, Mr. Eastwood.

834
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,651
Anything I can do for you today,
Mr. Eastwood?

835
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,909
- No, that's fine.
- Good luck tomorrow, Mr. Eastwood.

836
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,741
- We'll be praying for you.
- Thanks.

837
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:51,209
Good morning, Mr. Eastwood.
Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?

838
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,250
I'm fine. Thanks.

839
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:09,897
- Doc, what are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

840
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,566
I was just out enjoying the morning air.

841
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:15,020
It's really lovely here in the morning.
Don't you think?

842
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,114
Yeah, it's lovely, doc.

843
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,178
So listen, we've got to load the delorean
up and get ready to roll, all right?

844
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,693
Hey, look at that, the tombstone.

845
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,289
Marty, let me see that photograph again.

846
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,911
My name, it's vanished.

847
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,371
Hey, that's great, doc. Don't you get it?

848
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,986
We're going back to the future tomorrow,
so everything's being erased.

849
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,841
But only my name is erased.

850
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,740
The tombstone itself
and the date still remain.

851
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,629
That doesn't make sense.

852
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,306
We know that this photograph represents
what will happen

853
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:47,727
if the events of today continue
to run their course into tomorrow.

854
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:50,146
- Right. So?
- Excuse me, Mr. Eastwood.

855
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,851
- I just need to take your measurements.
- Oh, look, pal, I don't want to buy a suit.

856
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:58,230
- No, this is for your coffin.
- My coffin?

857
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,781
Well, the odds are running
two to one against you.

858
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,234
Might as well be prepared.

859
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,742
So it may not be my name that's
supposed to end up on this tombstone.

860
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,573
It may be yours.

861
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,918
- Great Scott.
- I know. This is heavy.

862
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,961
Marty, why are you wearing that gun?

863
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,193
You're not considering going up
against tannen tomorrow?

864
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:19,050
Doc, tomorrow morning
I'm going back to the future with you.

865
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:22,595
But if buford tannen comes looking
for trouble, I'm gonna be ready for him.

866
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:25,014
You heard what
that son of a bitch called me last night.

867
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,955
Marty, you can't go losing your judgment
every time someone calls you a name.

868
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:32,348
That's exactly what causes you
to get into that accident in the future.

869
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:37,398
What? What about my future?

870
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,605
I can't tell you. It
might make things worse.

871
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,534
Wait a minute.
Doc, what is wrong with my future?

872
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:50,123
Marty, we all have to make decisions
that affect the course of our lives.

873
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:54,999
You've got to do what you've got to do,
and I've got to do what I've got to do.

874
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,550
Marty. Yeah.

875
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,431
- I've made a decision.
- Uh-huh.

876
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,801
I'm not going with you tomorrow.

877
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,438
I'm staying here.

878
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,653
What are you talking about, doc?

879
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,605
There's no point in denying it.

880
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,237
- I'm in love with Clara.
- Oh, man.

881
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:29,412
Doc, we don't belong here.
Neither one of us.

882
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:32,366
You know, it could still be you
that gets shot tomorrow.

883
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,997
This tombstone could
still be in your future.

884
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:38,421
Marty, the future isn't written.

885
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,920
It can be changed. You know that.

886
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:46,008
Anyone can make their future
whatever they want it to be.

887
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:50,468
I can't let this one little photograph
determine my entire destiny.

888
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:55,726
I have to live my life according
to what I believe is right in my heart.

889
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:00,936
Doc, you're a scientist.

890
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:07,446
So you tell me.
What's the right thing to do up here?

891
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:22,669
You're right, Marty.

892
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:49,697
- Wow, that worked great.
- I've at least got to tell her goodbye.

893
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:55,035
Come on, doc. Think about it.
What are you gonna say to her?

894
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,566
"I've got to go back to the future?"

895
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,913
I mean,
she's not gonna understand that, doc.

896
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:02,668
Hell, I'm in it with you,
and I don't even understand it.

897
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,177
Doc, listen.

898
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:11,089
Maybe we...

899
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:14,517
I don't know,
maybe we can just take Clara with us.

900
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,186
To the future?

901
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:26,817
As you reminded me, Marty, I'm a scientist,
so I must be scientific about this.

902
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,739
I cautioned you
about disrupting the continuum

903
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:32,489
for your own personal benefit.
Therefore, I must do no less.

904
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,788
We shall proceed as planned,
and as soon as we return to 1985,

905
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:39,333
we'll destroy this infernal machine.

906
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,073
It's Emmett, Clara.

907
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,910
Emmett, won't you come in?

908
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,121
No, I better not. I...

909
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,666
What's wrong?

910
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,757
I've come to say goodbye.

911
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:36,015
Goodbye? Well, where are you going?

912
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:41,346
I'm going away. And well, I'm
afraid I'll never see you again.

913
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,185
Emmett!

914
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:49,488
Clara, I want you to know
that I care about you deeply.

915
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:55,948
But I've realized that I don't belong here,
and I have to go back where I came from.

916
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,575
And where might that be?

917
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,372
I can't tell you.

918
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,458
Well, wherever you're going,
take me with you.

919
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,041
I can't, Clara.

920
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:13,094
I wish it didn't have to be this way,
but just believe me when I tell you

921
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:17,640
that I'll never forget
you and that I love you.

922
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:22,053
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

923
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:26,016
Clara, I don't think there's any way
that you can understand it.

924
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,102
Please, Emmett. Please, I have to know.

925
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:32,279
If you sincerely do love me,
then tell me the truth.

926
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,988
All right then.

927
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:38,278
I'm from the future.

928
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:43,325
I came here in a time machine
that I invented,

929
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:47,503
and tomorrow I have to go back
to the year 1985.

930
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,177
Yes, Emmett.

931
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,218
I do understand.

932
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:05,521
I understand that because you know
I'm partial to the writings of Jules verne,

933
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:09,146
you concocted those mendacities
in order to take advantage of me.

934
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,566
Oh! I've heard some whoppers in my day,

935
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:15,217
but the fact that you'd expect me
to entertain a notion like that

936
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,984
is so insulting and degrading!

937
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:23,748
All you had to say is, "I don't love you,
and I don't want to see you anymore."

938
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,291
That, at least, would have been respectful!

939
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:28,411
But that's not the truth.

940
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,910
Man: Good to see you, too.

941
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,749
Emmett. What can I get you? The usual?

942
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:18,632
No, Chester, I'm gonna need something
a lot stronger than that tonight.

943
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,590
- Sarsapatrilla.
- Whiskey, Chester.

944
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,888
Whiskey? Emmett, are you sure?

945
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:27,311
You know what happened to you
on the fourth of July.

946
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:28,604
Whiskey.

947
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:33,192
Okay, I ain't your papa.

948
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,521
Just don't want to see you
do the wrong thing.

949
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,903
You can leave the bottle.

950
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,573
It's a woman, right?

951
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,498
I knew it.
I have seen that look on a man's face

952
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:50,452
a thousand times all across the country.

953
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,912
All I can tell you, friend,
is you'll get over her.

954
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:56,420
Oh... Clara was one in a million.

955
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:01,713
One in a billion. One in a googolplex.

956
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:05,425
The woman of my dreams,
and I've lost her for all time.

957
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:10,187
I can assure you, sir,
there are other women.

958
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,890
Why, peddling this barbed wire
all across the country

959
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,317
has taught me one thing for certain,

960
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,362
is that you never know
what the future might bring.

961
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:22,317
The future.
Oh, I can tell you about the future.

962
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,749
Oh, man, did I sleep.

963
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:39,667
What time is it, doc?

964
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:44,847
Doc?

965
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,401
Buford: Wake up!

966
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,067
Get up! Let's go!

967
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,317
I got me a runt to kill.

968
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:07,369
It's still early, boss. What's your hurry?

969
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,700
I'm hungry.

970
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:13,538
And in the future, we don't need horses.

971
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:18,714
We have motorized carriages
called automobiles.

972
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,218
If everybody's got
one of these auto whatsits,

973
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,717
does anybody walk or run anymore?

974
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:30,305
Of course we run,
but for recreation, for fun.

975
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:34,059
Run for fun?
What the hell kind of fun is that?

976
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,567
Doc! Doc!

977
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,159
How much has he had?

978
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:58,587
None. That's the first one,
and he hasn't touched it yet.

979
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,006
He just likes to hold it.

980
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:07,471
Doc! Doc! What are you doing?

981
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:11,763
I've lost her, Marty.
There's nothing left for me here.

982
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,814
All right, that's why you gotta come back
with me.

983
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,097
- Where?
- Back to the future!

984
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:23,521
- Right! Let's get going!
- Great.

985
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:26,733
Gentlemen, excuse me,
but my friend and I have to catch a train.

986
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,533
Here's to you, blacksmith.

987
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,033
And to the future. Amen.

988
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:33,079
- Amen.
- Emmett, no!

989
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,212
Doc! Doc! Doc!

990
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,174
Come on, doc. Wake up. Wake up, doc!

991
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,386
- How many did he have?
- Just the one.

992
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,593
Just the one? Come on, doc.

993
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,928
There's a fellow that
can't hold his liquor.

994
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,890
- Get me some coffee. Black!
- Joey, coffee!

995
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,027
Ma'am?

996
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:15,490
- How far does the 8:00 train go?
- San Francisco is the end of the line.

997
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,288
I'll take a one-way ticket.

998
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,664
You want to sober him up in a hurry, son,

999
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,819
you're gonna have to use something
a lot stronger than coffee.

1000
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,425
Yeah, what do you suggest?

1001
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,926
Joey, let's make some wake-up juice.

1002
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,507
Come on, doc, swallow. Here we go.

1003
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:43,685
In about 10 minutes, he's gonna be
as sober as a priest on Sunday.

1004
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:45,857
Ten minutes!

1005
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,405
Why do we have to cut these things
so damn close?

1006
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:51,199
Here, stick this clothespin on his nose.

1007
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:58,700
When he opens up his mouth,
go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.

1008
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,534
Oh, and stand back.

1009
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:22,269
- He's still out!
- Oh, that? That was just a reflex action.

1010
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:25,692
It's gonna take a few more minutes
for the stuff to really clear up his head.

1011
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:26,985
Perfect.

1012
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,376
Marty: Come on, doc.
Come on, wake up, buddy.

1013
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:53,338
Wake up, doc! Come on. Come on.

1014
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:56,014
Seamus, wouldn't expect
to see you here this morning.

1015
01:20:56,101 --> 01:21:00,060
Aye. Something inside me told me
I should be here

1016
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:04,223
as if my future had
something to do with it.

1017
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,356
He'll come around in a minute. Come on.

1018
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:12,440
Come on, doc. Let's go, doc!
Let's wake up now, buddy. Come on.

1019
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,790
Are you in there, Eastwood?

1020
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,795
It's 8:00, and I'm calling you out.

1021
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,381
It's not 8:00 yet!

1022
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,762
It is by my watch!

1023
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:38,761
Let's settle this once and for all, runt!

1024
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:42,765
Or ain't you got the gumption?

1025
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,481
Listen.

1026
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:58,827
I'm not really feeling up to this today.

1027
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,031
So I'm gonna have to forfeit.

1028
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:04,995
Forfeit?

1029
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,369
What's that mean?

1030
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:12,625
- It means that you win without a fight.
- Without shooting? He can't do that.

1031
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,835
Hey, you can't do that!

1032
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,420
You know what I think?

1033
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:19,848
I think you ain't nothing
but a gutless, yellow turd!

1034
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:24,599
And I'm giving you to the count of 10
to come out here and prove I'm wrong!

1035
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:26,809
One!

1036
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,482
Doc, come on, sober up, buddy.
Let's go. Come on.

1037
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,936
- Two!
- Man: You better get out there, son.

1038
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:35,147
I got $20 gold bet on you,
so don't let me down.

1039
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,448
Three!

1040
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:40,744
I got $30 gold bet against you,
so don't let me down.

1041
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:41,831
Four!

1042
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:46,375
You better face up to it, son,
because if you don't go out there...

1043
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:47,918
- What?
- Fivel

1044
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:52,335
what if I don't go out there?
You're a coward.

1045
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:53,506
Six!

1046
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:56,757
And you'll be branded a coward
for the rest of your days!

1047
01:22:56,847 --> 01:23:00,965
Everybody everywhere
will say Clint Eastwood

1048
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:03,766
is the biggest yellow belly in the west!

1049
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:09,936
Seven!

1050
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,101
Herel

1051
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,401
buford: Eight!

1052
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,457
I already got a gun.

1053
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,786
Buford: Ninel!

1054
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:36,671
Ten!

1055
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,473
Do you hear me, runt?

1056
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,769
I said that's 10, you gutless,
yellow pie-slinger!

1057
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,684
He's an asshole!

1058
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,735
I don't care what tannen says!

1059
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:58,780
And I don't care
what anybody else says either.

1060
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,367
- Doc! Doc, you okay?
- I think so.

1061
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,078
What a headache!

1062
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:08,032
- Listen, you got a back door to this place?
- Yeah, it's in the back.

1063
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,161
Let's go, doc.

1064
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:12,791
Are you coming out here,
or do I have to come in after you?

1065
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,627
The thing I really miss here is Tylenol.

1066
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:18,626
Hey!

1067
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,179
Reach, blacksmith!

1068
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:45,868
Man: Yes, sir, that poor fellow last night

1069
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,915
had the worst case of broken heart
I have ever seen.

1070
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:53,039
When he said he didn't know
how he could live the rest of his life

1071
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,917
knowing how much hurt
he'd caused that little girl.

1072
01:24:56,008 --> 01:25:00,047
Well, I really felt for him.
I did. Right here.

1073
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,590
Buford: Listen up, Eastwood!

1074
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:10,098
I aim to shoot somebody today,
and I prefer it'd be you.

1075
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:12,725
But if you're just too damn yellow,

1076
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:15,273
I guess it'll just have to be
your blacksmith friend.

1077
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,772
Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!

1078
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:27,365
You got one minute to decide.
You hear me, runt? One minute!

1079
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:33,576
I've never seen a man so broken up
over a woman.

1080
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,286
What did he say her name was? Cara? Sara?

1081
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,917
- Clara.
- Clara.

1082
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,959
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am?

1083
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:47,472
But was this man tall
with great big, brown puppy-dog eyes

1084
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:50,050
and long silvery, flowing hair?

1085
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,351
You know him.

1086
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,312
Emmett!

1087
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,030
Time's up, runt!

1088
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,964
Prepare to meet your maker, blacksmith.

1089
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:22,837
Right here, tannen!

1090
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:01,667
Draw!

1091
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:06,126
No!

1092
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:24,274
I thought we could settle this like men.

1093
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,815
You thought wrong, dude.

1094
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,471
Thank you.

1095
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,778
That was good.

1096
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,540
- You know what I think?
- No.

1097
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:04,040
I think buford's going to jail.
Yeah.

1098
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:11,801
Get him out of that shit.

1099
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:13,424
Get them!

1100
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:22,054
Buford tannen, you're under arrest
for robbing the pine city stage.

1101
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:24,264
You got anything to say?

1102
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,233
I hate manure.

1103
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:32,359
Look!

1104
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,361
Yes!

1105
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:41,118
- The train!
- Can we make it?

1106
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,120
We'll have to cut them off at coyote pass.

1107
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,417
Hey! Hey, mister. Mr. Eastwood.

1108
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,965
- Here's your gun, mister.
- Thanks, kid.

1109
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,014
Seamus!

1110
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,100
It's worth $12. Never been used.

1111
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:07,016
- Maybe I'll trade it for a new hat.
- Right, and take care of that baby!

1112
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,476
I willl.

1113
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:17,446
Emmett!

1114
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,071
Emmett!

1115
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:23,782
Emmett!

1116
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,334
"Time machine."

1117
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:14,802
Come on, Marty!

1118
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:21,389
- Go, doc.
- Come on. Give me your hand!

1119
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:58,296
Come on, Marty.

1120
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:04,265
Come on. Let's go!

1121
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:14,275
Masks on.

1122
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,918
- Reach!
- Is this a holdup?

1123
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:36,335
It's a science experiment.

1124
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:39,259
Stop the train just before you hit
the switch track up ahead.

1125
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:58,194
- Doc!
- Uncouple the cars from the tender!

1126
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:26,472
I've wanted to do that all my life.

1127
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,250
What are these things, anyway?

1128
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:04,176
My own version of pres-to-logs.

1129
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:07,973
Compressed wood with anthracite dust
chemically treated to burn hotter and longer.

1130
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,471
I use them in my forge
so I don't have to stoke it.

1131
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:12,602
These three in the furnace
will ignite sequentially,

1132
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,309
make the fire burn hotter,
kick up the boiler pressure,

1133
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,765
and make the train go faster.

1134
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,494
Ready to roll!

1135
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:03,440
Emmett!

1136
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:10,576
Marty, are the time circuits on?

1137
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:12,789
Check, doc!

1138
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,540
Input the destination time.

1139
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:19,336
October 27, 1985, 11:00 A.M.

1140
01:35:20,757 --> 01:35:25,091
Check. Okay, we're cruising
at a steady 25 miles an hour, doc.

1141
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:26,964
Doc: I'm throwing in the pres-to-logs.

1142
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:40,106
Marty, the new Gauge on the dashboard
will tell us the boiler temperature.

1143
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:43,560
It's color-coded to indicate
when each log will fire.

1144
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,145
Green, yellow and red.

1145
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:49,482
Each detonation will be accompanied
by a sudden burst of acceleration.

1146
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:56,532
Hopefully, we'll hit 88 miles per hour
before the needle gets much past 2,000.

1147
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:59,333
Why? What happens after it hits 2,000?

1148
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,206
The whole boiler explodes!

1149
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,253
Perfect!

1150
01:36:19,232 --> 01:36:23,066
- Hey, doc! We just hit 35!
- Okay, Marty. I'm coming aboard!

1151
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:34,871
Emmett!

1152
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,621
Emmett!

1153
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,375
Come on. Come on.

1154
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,922
You better hold onto something, doc!
The yellow log is about to blow!

1155
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:00,223
Golly.

1156
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:05,562
We just passed 40, doc!

1157
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,294
Emmett!

1158
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,468
Emmett!

1159
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:39,847
Emmett!

1160
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,935
We just passed 45, doc! Go for it!

1161
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:56,328
Fifty.

1162
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:09,581
- Emmett!
- Clara! I.

1163
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:12,003
I love you!

1164
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:19,678
- Doc! Doc! What's happening?
- It's Clara! She's on the train!

1165
01:38:20,269 --> 01:38:21,679
Clara? Perfect.

1166
01:38:22,313 --> 01:38:25,897
She's in the cab! I'm going back for her!

1167
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,063
The windmill!

1168
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:31,064
Doc! The windmill! We're going past 50!
You'll never make it!

1169
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:37,530
Then we'll have to take her back with us!
Keep calling out the speed!

1170
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,987
Clara, climb out here to me!

1171
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,915
- I don't know if I can!
- You can do it!

1172
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:46,117
Just don't look down!

1173
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:50,830
That's it!

1174
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,683
Sixty miles an hour, doc!

1175
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:12,982
You're doing fine! Nice and steady!

1176
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:17,857
Come on!

1177
01:39:18,578 --> 01:39:20,660
Just a little further!

1178
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,702
I can't, Emmett! I'm scared!

1179
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:26,209
Seventy!

1180
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,917
Keep coming, Clara!

1181
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:33,293
Come on! Come on! You're doing fine!

1182
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:38,215
Come on! Nice and easy!

1183
01:39:39,474 --> 01:39:42,307
Don't look down! That's it!
You're doing fine!

1184
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:49,347
Doc! The red log is about to blow!

1185
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:58,033
Claral.

1186
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,576
Emmett!

1187
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:14,084
I'm trying to reach youl!

1188
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:16,712
- Clara, hold on!
- I can't!

1189
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:25,845
Ohl

1190
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:28,769
doc, I'm gonna slip you the hoverboard!

1191
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:38,070
Marty, watch out!

1192
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:48,080
Emmett, help!

1193
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:52,331
Hold on, Clara!

1194
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:57,290
Doc, ready, doc?

1195
01:40:58,511 --> 01:40:59,546
Catch it!

1196
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:02,545
Yes! Yes!

1197
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:14,474
Emmett!

1198
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:15,979
Hold on!

1199
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:20,657
Yes!

1200
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:02,441
Well, doc,

1201
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,115
Just like you wanted.

1202
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:31,261
- Hey, butthead, get away...
- Watch it, biff!

1203
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:34,590
Marty, I didn't mean to scare you.
I didn't recognize you in those clothes.

1204
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:38,894
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just putting on the second coat now.

1205
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:41,434
You going cowboy, huh?

1206
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:44,187
Come on, guys.
We're gonna be late for brunch.

1207
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:45,338
Older Lorraine: Coming, Dave.

1208
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:48,274
Come on, dad, we're not gonna hold
your reservations all day.

1209
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,801
Older George: I can't find my glasses.

1210
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:53,283
- Lorraine, have you seen my glasses?
- They're in your suede jacket, honey.

1211
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:55,986
Marty, what's wrong?
We thought you went to the lake.

1212
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:59,244
- You wore that to the lake?
- Thank god you guys are all back to normal.

1213
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:01,371
Marty, who are you supposed to be?
Clint Eastwood?

1214
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:05,208
Right. I gotta go get Jennifer.

1215
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:11,072
I really like that hat, Marty.

1216
01:45:11,096 --> 01:45:12,632
Thanks, biff.

1217
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:28,402
Jennifer.

1218
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:31,647
Jen.

1219
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:37,244
Jennifer.

1220
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:01,597
Marty.

1221
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:04,347
Marty.

1222
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:07,774
I had the worst nightmare.

1223
01:46:14,243 --> 01:46:17,701
Marty, that dream I had is so real.

1224
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:20,245
It was about the future.

1225
01:46:20,332 --> 01:46:22,323
About us.

1226
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:24,659
And you got fired.

1227
01:46:24,753 --> 01:46:27,085
Wait a minute.
What do you mean I got fired?

1228
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:29,254
Marty: "Hilldale."

1229
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:33,876
Hilldale! This 1s where we live.

1230
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:36,929
I mean, this is where we're going to live.

1231
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:39,469
Someday.

1232
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:45,972
Marty, it was a dream, wasn't it?

1233
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,151
Hey.

1234
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:53,354
The big m.

1235
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:56,782
- How's it hanging, mcfly?
- Hey, needles.

1236
01:46:56,869 --> 01:47:00,987
Nice set of wheels.
Let's see what she can do.

1237
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:03,322
- Next green light.
- No, thanks.

1238
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:07,159
What's the matter? Chicken?

1239
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,207
Boy: Chicken mcfly.

1240
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:10,506
Whoo!

1241
01:47:11,842 --> 01:47:14,800
- Marty, don't.
- Grab hold of something.

1242
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,510
Come on! Get on!

1243
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:21,181
Yeah, go! Go, go, go!

1244
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:45,185
Jennifer: Did you do that on purpose?

1245
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:47,700
Yeah, you think I'm stupid enough
to race that asshole?

1246
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:56,876
Jeez! I would have hit that Rolls-Royce.

1247
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:08,516
It erased.

1248
01:48:22,579 --> 01:48:24,444
You're right. There's not much left.

1249
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:29,075
Doc's never coming back.

1250
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:45,220
I'm sure gonna miss him, Jen.

1251
01:48:57,865 --> 01:48:58,945
What the hell?

1252
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:17,498
Doc!

1253
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,090
Marty!

1254
01:49:19,178 --> 01:49:21,385
Doc! Doc!

1255
01:49:21,472 --> 01:49:24,305
Marty, it runs on steam!

1256
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:33,097
Meet the family. Clara, you know.

1257
01:49:33,192 --> 01:49:35,524
- Hi, Marty!
- Ma'am!

1258
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,731
These are our boys.

1259
01:49:39,531 --> 01:49:43,319
Jules and verne.

1260
01:49:46,455 --> 01:49:49,288
Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.

1261
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:54,247
Doc, I thought I'd never see you again.

1262
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:56,579
You can't keep a good scientist down.

1263
01:49:56,673 --> 01:49:58,755
After all, I had to come back for Einstein,

1264
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:02,175
and, well, I didn't want you
to be worried about me.

1265
01:50:02,805 --> 01:50:03,805
Ohl.

1266
01:50:04,223 --> 01:50:06,680
I brought you a little souvenir.

1267
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:26,530
It's great, doc. Thanks.

1268
01:50:28,914 --> 01:50:32,748
Dr. brown, I brought this note
back from the future,

1269
01:50:32,835 --> 01:50:35,076
and now it's erased.

1270
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:37,126
Of course it's erased.

1271
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,380
But what does that mean?

1272
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:44,335
It means your future
hasn't been written yet.

1273
01:50:44,429 --> 01:50:46,169
No one's has.

1274
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:51,305
Your future is whatever you make it.
So make it a good one, both of you.

1275
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:55,645
We will, doc!

1276
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:57,268
Stand back!

1277
01:50:57,776 --> 01:50:59,892
All right, boys, buckle up!

1278
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:10,032
Hey, doc, where are you going now?
Back to the future?

1279
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:13,910
No, already been there.
